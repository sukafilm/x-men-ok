1
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:56,218
- You're always sick.
- You were sick when you were my age.

2
00:00:59,158 --> 00:01:02,559
- Evening, sir.
- Evening, Victor.

3
00:01:03,295 --> 00:01:05,889
I didn't realize you were still here.

4
00:01:06,632 --> 00:01:10,398
I was just keeping James company, sir,
if that's all right.

5
00:01:12,237 --> 00:01:13,898
Very kind of you.

6
00:01:15,107 --> 00:01:17,837
- Any better, Son?
- Still cold, Father.

7
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,741
Just a mild fever.

8
00:01:19,812 --> 00:01:23,043
- You'll be all right in the morning.
- You always say that.

9
00:01:23,115 --> 00:01:25,413
And you always pull through, don't you?

10
00:01:25,484 --> 00:01:28,920
- Yeah.
- Now, you taking your medicine?

11
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:33,453
Elizabeth! Elizabeth!

12
00:01:34,126 --> 00:01:36,390
- Your father's drunk again.
- Elizabeth!

13
00:01:36,462 --> 00:01:40,831
- You should help him home, Victor.
- It's not my name he's calling, sir.

14
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:44,096
- Father!
- Stay where you are, James.

15
00:01:44,169 --> 00:01:46,069
- Get off me!
- Father!

16
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:49,234
Now! You never loved him!

17
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:52,370
I told you never to come back here.

18
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:00,617
Get out!

19
00:02:12,097 --> 00:02:13,689
James?

20
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,295
- No.
- James?

21
00:02:22,407 --> 00:02:24,307
- There are things you don't understand.
- Don't.

22
00:02:24,376 --> 00:02:26,003
- I need him to know!
- Please don't.

23
00:02:26,078 --> 00:02:28,046
- No more lies.
- James...

24
00:02:45,998 --> 00:02:47,829
- No!
- James!

25
00:02:53,438 --> 00:02:56,635
He... He wasn't your father,

26
00:03:04,983 --> 00:03:06,314
Son.

27
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:16,619
What are you?

28
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:35,009
- I didn't mean it! I didn't mean it!
- Yes, you did!

29
00:03:36,014 --> 00:03:39,040
He deserved it, and you gave it to him.

30
00:03:42,154 --> 00:03:44,884
We're brothers, Jimmy. You realize that?

31
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,890
And brothers protect each other.

32
00:03:48,193 --> 00:03:51,959
You have to be hard now,
hard so nothing can ever touch us.

33
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:55,589
- I want to go home.
- We can't.

34
00:03:56,001 --> 00:03:58,265
We stick together, no matter what,

35
00:03:58,337 --> 00:04:01,500
and take care of anyone
who gets in our way.

36
00:04:01,573 --> 00:04:04,064
Can you do that, little brother?

37
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:08,876
- I'm going down to the river.
- They're coming.

38
00:04:08,947 --> 00:04:11,780
- Head over the hill. Hurry!
- Can you run?

39
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,689
- Keep on running and don't look back.
- Okay.

40
00:05:22,287 --> 00:05:23,754
Back to back!

41
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:22,503
That's enough!

42
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:26,345
Enough!

43
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:41,122
No! No!

44
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:44,198
Stand down, soldier!

45
00:06:49,975 --> 00:06:51,408
Victor!

46
00:06:54,513 --> 00:06:55,980
Stand down! Stand down!

47
00:06:56,047 --> 00:06:58,345
Stand down!

48
00:07:01,853 --> 00:07:03,047
No!

49
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:32,082
Ready, aim...

50
00:07:32,684 --> 00:07:34,481
Wake me when it's over.

51
00:07:43,962 --> 00:07:45,020
...fire!

52
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:54,435
Freaks! You're animals! Freaks!

53
00:07:54,506 --> 00:07:56,838
My name is Major William Stryker.

54
00:07:56,908 --> 00:08:00,071
You've been charged
with killing a senior officer.

55
00:08:00,145 --> 00:08:02,079
Is that correct?

56
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:04,308
Apparently, we have some issues
with authority...

57
00:08:04,382 --> 00:08:07,078
- Just keep a lid on it.
- ...sir.

58
00:08:08,186 --> 00:08:11,019
The warden tells me that your sentence
was carried out by a firing squad

59
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:12,954
at 1000 hours.

60
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:15,219
- How'd that go?
- lt tickled.

61
00:08:20,198 --> 00:08:24,635
You boys tired of running?
Tired of denying your true nature?

62
00:08:25,637 --> 00:08:28,071
- What do you care?
- Oh, I care.

63
00:08:28,874 --> 00:08:31,434
I care because I know how special you are.

64
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,205
How valuable.

65
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:41,451
Look, you can stay here
locked up like freaks of nature,

66
00:08:42,587 --> 00:08:44,384
or you can join me.

67
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,120
I'm putting together a special team
with special privileges.

68
00:08:50,161 --> 00:08:54,495
Now, tell me, how would you like
to really serve your country?

69
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:09,636
You know, I love this weapon

70
00:09:09,714 --> 00:09:11,238
more than any other thing
in the whole wide world.

71
00:09:11,316 --> 00:09:13,307
- Do you wanna know why?
- No.

72
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:15,746
It's memorable.

73
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,947
Sure, it's a little bulky,
tough to get on a plane.

74
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:21,550
You whip out a couple of swords
at your ex-girlfriend's wedding,

75
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:23,924
they will never, ever forget it.

76
00:09:23,995 --> 00:09:25,826
That's funny, Wade.

77
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:29,264
I think you confuse me
with someone who gives a shit.

78
00:09:29,334 --> 00:09:32,098
Right, it's probably not
as intimidating as having a gun

79
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:36,072
or bone claws
or the fingernails of a bag lady.

80
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:48,010
- Manicure?
- Victor. Easy.

81
00:09:50,622 --> 00:09:53,386
Fred got a new tattoo. I'm concerned.

82
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:57,284
Oh, Jesus, Fred,
you just met her last night.

83
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:00,123
- I love her.
- You love her after one night?

84
00:10:00,198 --> 00:10:01,825
She's a gymnast.

85
00:10:03,201 --> 00:10:05,101
Bradley, take her down.

86
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,801
Oh, God.

87
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:13,810
- Are you gonna puke?
- lf we were meant to fly,

88
00:10:13,878 --> 00:10:15,675
- we'd grow wings.
- Don't worry, Nancy.

89
00:10:15,747 --> 00:10:19,148
- More people die driving than flying.
- How about from impaling?

90
00:10:19,217 --> 00:10:22,345
Hey, be nice,
or be your approximation of nice.

91
00:10:23,855 --> 00:10:25,846
- Would you like a bucket?
- No.

92
00:10:25,924 --> 00:10:28,085
Gentlemen, wheels down in Lagos in five.

93
00:11:03,995 --> 00:11:08,159
- Why are we here?
- All in good time. Zero?

94
00:11:13,838 --> 00:11:17,899
- lntruder! Perimeter breach!
- Man the weapon!

95
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:23,511
Intruder, stop!
Put your hands behind your head!

96
00:11:53,011 --> 00:11:54,569
Having fun yet?

97
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:01,676
- Fred?
- The tank?

98
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,884
- The tank.
- Yeah, I got that.

99
00:12:39,924 --> 00:12:44,327
Great. Stuck in an elevator
with five guys on a high-protein diet.

100
00:12:44,395 --> 00:12:46,226
- Wade.
- Dreams really do come true.

101
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:47,389
Just shut it!

102
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:50,457
- You're up next. - Thank you, sir.
You look really nice today.

103
00:12:50,535 --> 00:12:53,060
It's the green.
It brings out the seriousness in your eyes.

104
00:12:53,138 --> 00:12:57,097
- Oh, my God. Do you ever shut up, pal?
- No. Not when I'm awake.

105
00:12:57,976 --> 00:13:00,069
Bradley? Top floor, please.

106
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,045
Cover the elevator! The elevator!

107
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:22,730
Time to go to work.

108
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:02,396
Okay. People are dead.

109
00:14:05,176 --> 00:14:09,408
If you didn't have that mouth on you,
Wade, you'd be the perfect soldier.

110
00:14:14,452 --> 00:14:17,250
I wouldn't do that if I was you, brother.

111
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:25,821
- Take the diamonds. They're yours.
- I don't want your diamonds.

112
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:28,631
I want this.

113
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,335
But that is nothing. A souvenir.

114
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:35,904
Where did you find it? I want the source.

115
00:14:36,908 --> 00:14:41,675
A small village, far inland,
three days from here.

116
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:47,777
Tell him this rock is
more valuable to me than his life.

117
00:14:47,852 --> 00:14:49,911
Ask him where he found it.

118
00:15:00,665 --> 00:15:02,132
Okay.

119
00:15:03,234 --> 00:15:05,099
He says it came from the sky.

120
00:15:09,173 --> 00:15:11,141
He's telling the truth.

121
00:15:11,976 --> 00:15:13,807
You don't know the language, Logan.

122
00:15:13,878 --> 00:15:16,005
- It's a meteor fragment.
- I know what it is.

123
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,480
I'm asking him where he found it.

124
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:21,074
Sir, base wants to know our location.

125
00:15:21,152 --> 00:15:23,416
- Shut them down.
- Yes.

126
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,849
Tell him everyone here will die

127
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:30,895
unless he tells me
where he found the rock.

128
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:43,701
- He says that it's sacred.
- Okay, fine.

129
00:15:47,478 --> 00:15:48,877
Victor.

130
00:16:05,897 --> 00:16:07,330
Victor!

131
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:13,096
Don't even think about it.

132
00:16:14,505 --> 00:16:16,632
We didn't sign up for this.

133
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:21,803
Put him down!

134
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:36,089
What are you doing?

135
00:16:37,395 --> 00:16:39,886
We finally got a good thing going here.
Don't you screw this up.

136
00:16:39,964 --> 00:16:41,761
Enough. That's enough.
We've done enough.

137
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,926
Who do you think you are?

138
00:16:44,268 --> 00:16:45,997
This is what we do.

139
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:49,001
Maybe you'd rather be
rotting in a hole somewhere

140
00:16:49,073 --> 00:16:52,839
till they figure out a way to do it to us.
Is that it? Huh?

141
00:16:53,344 --> 00:16:54,777
I'm done.

142
00:16:57,215 --> 00:16:58,682
You coming?

143
00:17:05,323 --> 00:17:06,620
Jimmy!

144
00:17:12,063 --> 00:17:14,463
We can't just let you walk away.

145
00:17:23,007 --> 00:17:24,201
Jimmy!

146
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:28,408
Jimmy!

147
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:19,854
Why are you up so early?

148
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:23,866
Come here.

149
00:19:02,406 --> 00:19:03,998
See you, baby.

150
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:06,473
Hey.

151
00:19:13,351 --> 00:19:16,081
Oh, that's nice. Yes. Take your time.

152
00:19:18,122 --> 00:19:19,248
You're wrapped, man.

153
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:40,042
Okay, I'm totally gonna get this.

154
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:44,238
Nope. Come on.

155
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,250
Oh, wow! Let's go on the Ferris wheel.

156
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:49,752
- How does he do it?
- Come on.

157
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,447
...amazing lady in a box!

158
00:20:00,565 --> 00:20:02,829
Swing the hammer, ring the bell!

159
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,765
Hey, what do you do?

160
00:20:07,104 --> 00:20:09,334
If you turn off the light, you win a prize.

161
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:13,104
- Three tries for a buck.
- Come on, I wanna do it.

162
00:20:13,644 --> 00:20:15,441
There you go. Okay?

163
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,613
No, that's obvious.

164
00:20:25,356 --> 00:20:26,789
That's two.

165
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:37,628
Well, that's a stupid trick.

166
00:20:38,135 --> 00:20:40,035
It's not a trick, man.

167
00:20:40,404 --> 00:20:42,531
Come on. Freak.

168
00:20:44,475 --> 00:20:45,703
Bye.

169
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:15,705
Show's over!

170
00:21:20,711 --> 00:21:23,271
I said show's over!

171
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:30,744
The show's never over for us, Bradley.

172
00:21:33,257 --> 00:21:35,953
- Victor.
- Aren't you gonna invite me in?

173
00:21:38,462 --> 00:21:40,589
Yeah. Come on in.

174
00:21:53,377 --> 00:21:58,178
You know, I've never said anything
to anyone about what happened.

175
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:01,441
I'm living a totally
different life now, Victor.

176
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:03,783
No need to bring up the past.

177
00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:20,402
You know,

178
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:25,839
I always thought it would
be Wade to come knocking at my door.

179
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:29,471
Well... Well,

180
00:22:30,548 --> 00:22:31,981
Wade's gone.

181
00:22:35,486 --> 00:22:37,613
I'm not afraid of you, Victor.

182
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,349
I'm not afraid of dying.

183
00:22:43,594 --> 00:22:45,255
How do you know?

184
00:22:46,497 --> 00:22:48,727
You've never tried it before.

185
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:07,816
Was it the wars?

186
00:23:09,286 --> 00:23:10,719
Which one?

187
00:23:11,255 --> 00:23:12,688
All of them.

188
00:23:20,598 --> 00:23:23,431
- Tell me.
- Hey.

189
00:23:24,268 --> 00:23:26,099
It's just a scratch.

190
00:23:33,444 --> 00:23:36,436
Looks like we're gonna need
new sheets again, baby.

191
00:23:36,514 --> 00:23:37,947
Yeah.

192
00:24:02,706 --> 00:24:04,640
Who the hell is this?

193
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:06,676
Smells like government.

194
00:24:10,881 --> 00:24:13,315
My God. Haven't aged a day!

195
00:24:13,384 --> 00:24:14,908
Clean living.

196
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:19,981
- You remember Agent Zero?
- Still shooting first, asking questions later?

197
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:25,723
- You still chewing on cheap cigars?
- Boys, please.

198
00:24:27,198 --> 00:24:29,496
- I have a job for you.
- I already have a job.

199
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:31,694
Lumberjack? 18 grand a year?

200
00:24:31,769 --> 00:24:35,205
18.5. Plus I haven't had to kill anyone
in a while.

201
00:24:35,272 --> 00:24:37,263
- Starting to miss it?
- Right about now I am.

202
00:24:37,341 --> 00:24:39,639
- Yeah?
- Zero, back to the car.

203
00:24:43,214 --> 00:24:44,681
Attaboy.

204
00:24:51,255 --> 00:24:54,588
You know, I'm not proud about
the way things ended between us.

205
00:24:54,658 --> 00:24:56,558
Conversation's over.

206
00:24:57,528 --> 00:25:01,157
Playing Little House on the Prairie
with a schoolteacher,

207
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:03,362
I mean, that just isn't you, Logan.

208
00:25:03,534 --> 00:25:05,559
And you would know, huh?

209
00:25:05,936 --> 00:25:08,530
- I would.
- What do you want, Stryker?

210
00:25:10,674 --> 00:25:13,108
Bradley was killed three days ago.

211
00:25:14,144 --> 00:25:15,805
Wade before that.

212
00:25:16,547 --> 00:25:19,880
I believe that someone is hunting down
our old team.

213
00:25:20,818 --> 00:25:24,845
- Anyone else?
- As far as I know, Victor is safe.

214
00:25:26,657 --> 00:25:29,421
But whoever it is has names, addresses.

215
00:25:29,493 --> 00:25:31,552
I can take care of myself.

216
00:25:33,497 --> 00:25:35,761
This is not about you, Logan.

217
00:25:39,236 --> 00:25:41,170
Your country needs you.

218
00:25:42,206 --> 00:25:43,696
I'm Canadian.

219
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:47,506
I know you, Logan! I know who you are!

220
00:26:01,058 --> 00:26:05,017
- Miss Kayla, Miss Kayla, look what I did.
- What did you do?

221
00:26:16,373 --> 00:26:18,534
Bye, Miss Silverfox! Bye!

222
00:26:25,449 --> 00:26:26,939
What's wrong?

223
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,254
Stryker came by today.

224
00:26:32,356 --> 00:26:33,823
Don't worry. I said no.

225
00:26:33,891 --> 00:26:36,917
Why is he bothering you
after all these years?

226
00:26:36,994 --> 00:26:39,326
Because I'm the best there is at what I do,

227
00:26:39,396 --> 00:26:41,057
but what I do best isn't very nice.

228
00:26:41,131 --> 00:26:44,828
You're not an animal, Logan.
What you have is a gift.

229
00:26:44,902 --> 00:26:47,769
A gift. You can return a gift.

230
00:27:01,051 --> 00:27:02,643
Come on, fellas.

231
00:27:03,854 --> 00:27:05,287
All right.

232
00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:07,416
Stay in the car.

233
00:27:07,992 --> 00:27:10,119
I'm just gonna ask nicely.

234
00:27:14,131 --> 00:27:16,156
You mind letting us go by?

235
00:27:16,867 --> 00:27:18,494
- You in some kind of a hurry there, pal?
- Hey, hey, hey.

236
00:27:18,569 --> 00:27:19,866
Are you?

237
00:27:19,937 --> 00:27:21,199
Just move your truck so we can go by.

238
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:23,432
We're trying to have
a conversation there, all right?

239
00:27:23,507 --> 00:27:25,702
You start something,
you'd better be ready to finish it.

240
00:27:25,776 --> 00:27:27,141
Listen...

241
00:27:27,211 --> 00:27:30,180
Hey, guys, take it easy! Calm down.

242
00:27:34,718 --> 00:27:37,710
- Your boyfriend's got a big mouth.
- I know.

243
00:27:37,788 --> 00:27:41,724
Big temper, too. So please let us pass.

244
00:27:46,363 --> 00:27:49,890
- Thank you.
- Come on, man, let's go.

245
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:52,499
How'd you do that?

246
00:27:52,936 --> 00:27:55,564
Female powers of persuasion. It's a gift.

247
00:27:55,639 --> 00:27:59,040
Oh, I see.
Do you have those powers over me?

248
00:27:59,109 --> 00:28:01,976
Well, you didn't stay in the car, did you?

249
00:28:18,862 --> 00:28:21,194
Why is the moon so lonely?

250
00:28:22,566 --> 00:28:23,692
Why?

251
00:28:24,201 --> 00:28:26,499
Because she used to have a lover.

252
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,970
- You tell this to the kids?
- No.

253
00:28:30,074 --> 00:28:32,975
His name was Kuekuatsheu
and they lived in the Spirit World together.

254
00:28:33,043 --> 00:28:36,035
Oh, this is a true story? All right.

255
00:28:36,113 --> 00:28:38,843
And every night they would
wander the skies together,

256
00:28:40,484 --> 00:28:44,079
but one of the other spirits was jealous.

257
00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:48,119
Trickster wanted the moon for himself,

258
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:52,390
so he told Kuekuatsheu
that the moon had asked for flowers.

259
00:28:52,963 --> 00:28:56,797
He told him to come to our world
and pick her some wild roses,

260
00:28:57,067 --> 00:29:01,094
but Kuekuatsheu didn't know
that once you leave the Spirit World,

261
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:03,773
you can never go back.

262
00:29:04,775 --> 00:29:10,645
And every night he looks up in the sky
and sees the moon and howls her name.

263
00:29:13,917 --> 00:29:15,145
But

264
00:29:17,554 --> 00:29:19,784
he can never touch her again.

265
00:29:20,591 --> 00:29:21,683
Wow.

266
00:29:22,526 --> 00:29:24,756
Koo-koo-ka-choo got screwed.

267
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:28,222
"Kuekuatsheu."

268
00:29:34,805 --> 00:29:36,864
It means "the Wolverine".

269
00:30:38,035 --> 00:30:39,127
What you doing, Logan?

270
00:30:47,411 --> 00:30:48,571
Kayla.

271
00:31:32,723 --> 00:31:34,054
Oh, God.

272
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:36,387
Kayla!

273
00:32:40,524 --> 00:32:43,288
You're not from around here, are you?

274
00:32:48,098 --> 00:32:49,998
What gave me away?

275
00:32:51,935 --> 00:32:53,368
Victor!

276
00:32:54,304 --> 00:32:58,673
- You got insurance on this place?
- lnsurance? No.

277
00:33:00,043 --> 00:33:02,739
- Too bad.
- Victor!

278
00:33:16,393 --> 00:33:20,159
Well, well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.

279
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:23,463
Guys, whatever this is, take it outside.

280
00:33:34,811 --> 00:33:36,005
Why?

281
00:33:37,147 --> 00:33:38,512
Why?

282
00:33:42,853 --> 00:33:46,050
You don't call. You don't write.

283
00:33:48,091 --> 00:33:51,083
How else am I supposed
to get your attention?

284
00:34:29,232 --> 00:34:33,362
I hate to say it, Jimmy, but, frankly,
I'm a little disappointed.

285
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:37,229
Stay down.

286
00:35:14,911 --> 00:35:17,744
Tell me something, Jimmy.
Was she worth it?

287
00:35:38,268 --> 00:35:40,736
When are you gonna figure it out?

288
00:35:41,605 --> 00:35:43,436
We're not like them.

289
00:35:45,308 --> 00:35:47,538
I am nothing like you.

290
00:35:49,412 --> 00:35:50,936
Sure, you are.

291
00:35:52,215 --> 00:35:54,274
You just don't know it yet.

292
00:36:08,365 --> 00:36:11,664
- What do we got?
- Bar fight. Multiple knife wounds.

293
00:36:13,803 --> 00:36:15,896
What is this, a joke? Guy's fine.

294
00:36:15,972 --> 00:36:17,200
- Where is he?
- Hey, hey, don't...

295
00:36:17,274 --> 00:36:19,242
- I said, where is he?
- I don't know who he is.

296
00:36:19,309 --> 00:36:21,106
I can help you.

297
00:36:27,651 --> 00:36:29,619
Six years I've been here.

298
00:36:29,686 --> 00:36:33,452
No one knew me, and then you show up,
and the next day she's dead!

299
00:36:33,523 --> 00:36:34,854
I tried to warn you.

300
00:36:34,925 --> 00:36:36,916
Why didn't you tell me it was Victor?

301
00:36:36,993 --> 00:36:39,223
- I didn't know!
- Bullshit!

302
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:45,266
- Why?
- I swear on my son's life, I didn't!

303
00:36:52,676 --> 00:36:54,906
Victor's appetites were
becoming too public.

304
00:36:54,978 --> 00:36:57,970
I had to lock him up.
He felt I betrayed him.

305
00:36:58,748 --> 00:37:02,047
Went AWOL.
He said he was coming after all of us.

306
00:37:02,953 --> 00:37:04,716
You didn't come to warn me,

307
00:37:04,788 --> 00:37:07,086
you came to save your own ass.

308
00:37:07,624 --> 00:37:09,353
So what's your plan, Captain?

309
00:37:09,426 --> 00:37:11,553
You can't beat him, Logan,
you know you can't!

310
00:37:11,628 --> 00:37:14,028
I'm gonna find him and kill him.

311
00:37:15,098 --> 00:37:17,862
I can give you the tools to defeat him.

312
00:37:21,671 --> 00:37:23,571
And we can still save the others.

313
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,938
You mean save yourself, right?

314
00:37:27,844 --> 00:37:29,812
I promise you two things.

315
00:37:29,879 --> 00:37:33,110
You will suffer more pain
than any other man can endure,

316
00:37:33,183 --> 00:37:35,549
but you will have your revenge.

317
00:37:37,988 --> 00:37:41,253
I come with you, I'm coming for blood.

318
00:37:42,959 --> 00:37:45,655
No law. No code of conduct.

319
00:37:46,363 --> 00:37:50,299
You point me in the right direction,
you get the hell out of my way.

320
00:38:30,273 --> 00:38:34,175
When it starts, whatever the reason is
that you're doing this,

321
00:38:34,911 --> 00:38:37,971
focus on that. Maybe it will help.

322
00:38:38,048 --> 00:38:40,608
Trust me, I've been through worse.

323
00:38:40,684 --> 00:38:42,447
No, you haven't.

324
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,910
We're ready.

325
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:51,557
We're gonna make you indestructible,
but first we're gonna have to destroy you.

326
00:38:54,664 --> 00:38:57,758
You remember
what we were looking for in Africa?

327
00:38:57,834 --> 00:39:00,325
- I remember.
- Well, I found it.

328
00:39:02,672 --> 00:39:06,438
It helped us create
a metal compound so strong

329
00:39:06,509 --> 00:39:09,171
that you will be able to withstand
virtually anything.

330
00:39:09,245 --> 00:39:11,304
It's called Adamantium.

331
00:39:13,149 --> 00:39:15,811
I can't put Victor down myself, Logan.

332
00:39:16,953 --> 00:39:20,980
To kill him, you're gonna have to embrace
the other side.

333
00:39:23,693 --> 00:39:25,422
Become the animal.

334
00:39:27,597 --> 00:39:29,189
Let's do this.

335
00:39:29,632 --> 00:39:31,293
I almost forgot.

336
00:39:34,771 --> 00:39:36,432
I want new ones.

337
00:39:36,906 --> 00:39:39,170
What do you want them to say?

338
00:39:40,643 --> 00:39:41,667
Wolverine.

339
00:39:59,429 --> 00:40:01,329
Generals, welcome.

340
00:40:02,799 --> 00:40:04,494
General Munson.

341
00:40:05,368 --> 00:40:08,428
Today we're gonna witness
medical history.

342
00:40:08,505 --> 00:40:11,599
- Today we're gonna create Weapon X.
- X?

343
00:40:12,575 --> 00:40:14,270
Roman numeral 10.

344
00:40:16,613 --> 00:40:20,913
We are about to begin bonding
Adamantium to Weapon X's skeleton.

345
00:40:22,085 --> 00:40:23,552
Let's begin.

346
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:12,301
- We're brothers, Jimmy.
- Logan!

347
00:41:12,368 --> 00:41:14,893
Body temperature, 108 and rising.

348
00:41:17,841 --> 00:41:20,309
Why is he thrashing like that?
Why isn't he sedated?

349
00:41:20,376 --> 00:41:23,834
He feels pain just like the rest of us,
but anesthesia won't work on him.

350
00:41:23,913 --> 00:41:27,679
- That's why he had to volunteer.
- Heart rate, 190. 195.

351
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:30,275
- Will he survive this?
- I don't know.

352
00:41:30,353 --> 00:41:31,820
200.

353
00:41:34,257 --> 00:41:35,383
Son.

354
00:41:36,626 --> 00:41:38,287
Heart rate well beyond maximum.

355
00:41:38,361 --> 00:41:41,330
- Blood pressure?
- 260 over 180 and rising.

356
00:41:41,397 --> 00:41:43,729
He can make it. He can make it.

357
00:41:48,104 --> 00:41:49,332
Victor!

358
00:41:54,978 --> 00:41:56,206
I love you.

359
00:41:56,279 --> 00:41:57,906
You're not an animal.

360
00:42:04,454 --> 00:42:06,183
It means "the Wolverine".

361
00:42:33,016 --> 00:42:35,109
Well, I guess he can die.

362
00:43:06,115 --> 00:43:08,606
Come on, old friend. Come back.

363
00:43:12,121 --> 00:43:13,816
Heart rate rising.

364
00:43:15,224 --> 00:43:17,715
Adamantium reservoir is depleted.

365
00:43:17,794 --> 00:43:20,592
No rejection. Procedure completed.

366
00:43:20,964 --> 00:43:23,228
- We did it.
- We did it.

367
00:43:27,971 --> 00:43:29,495
Yeah! Yes.

368
00:43:30,106 --> 00:43:32,597
Are we taking him to the island?

369
00:43:32,675 --> 00:43:34,472
The island? No.

370
00:43:36,179 --> 00:43:38,079
The bonding works.

371
00:43:38,147 --> 00:43:40,411
We'll use his DNA for the Xl.

372
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:44,982
Erase his memory.

373
00:43:48,491 --> 00:43:50,220
Erase his memory.

374
00:43:59,769 --> 00:44:01,669
I think he heard you.

375
00:44:16,986 --> 00:44:18,510
Lock down!

376
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:58,456
Hunt him down. Take his head off.

377
00:45:40,169 --> 00:45:41,568
Travis.

378
00:45:49,345 --> 00:45:54,908
- I think there's a naked man in the barn.
- Yep.

379
00:46:26,616 --> 00:46:27,844
Son?

380
00:46:29,085 --> 00:46:31,053
What in hell you doing?

381
00:46:32,155 --> 00:46:34,020
- It's cold.
- Cold.

382
00:46:39,128 --> 00:46:41,688
- You got no clothes on.
- Yeah.

383
00:46:42,999 --> 00:46:45,763
- You're not on the drugs, are you?
- No.

384
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:50,799
- No, just had a rough night.
- Yeah, you could say that.

385
00:46:54,043 --> 00:46:56,034
Come on up to the house.

386
00:46:56,112 --> 00:46:59,604
Some of my son's old clothes
will probably fit you.

387
00:46:59,682 --> 00:47:02,150
Here. Cover it up with that, huh?

388
00:47:02,785 --> 00:47:06,118
I don't want you giving
the old lady a heart attack.

389
00:47:51,901 --> 00:47:55,029
- You all right in there?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine!

390
00:47:56,205 --> 00:47:58,105
Supper's on the table.

391
00:47:58,674 --> 00:48:00,335
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

392
00:48:11,821 --> 00:48:14,085
I swear, I'm gonna pay for it.

393
00:48:15,491 --> 00:48:19,154
- Set it down over there.
- Right.

394
00:48:22,765 --> 00:48:24,733
Come and sit down, son.

395
00:48:30,273 --> 00:48:33,367
I can't thank you both enough
for everything.

396
00:48:33,442 --> 00:48:36,605
It wouldn't have been decent
to leave you out there to freeze.

397
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:38,579
- "Decent."
- What?

398
00:48:40,549 --> 00:48:43,677
Nothing. I'm just not
really used to that word.

399
00:48:46,422 --> 00:48:48,287
That's a nice chopper you've got out there.

400
00:48:48,357 --> 00:48:50,723
- You know motorcycles?
- Oh! Lord, here we go.

401
00:48:50,793 --> 00:48:54,456
My favorite's a '48 Panhead.
Bought one new off the line.

402
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:56,623
I think you're a little young for that, son.

403
00:48:56,699 --> 00:48:59,759
You must be exhausted.
You get a good night's sleep.

404
00:48:59,835 --> 00:49:01,302
In the barn.

405
00:49:02,505 --> 00:49:04,871
Nothing you can break out there.

406
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:22,624
Why is the moon so lonely?

407
00:49:22,692 --> 00:49:24,125
Why?

408
00:49:24,593 --> 00:49:27,061
Because she used to have a lover.

409
00:49:29,098 --> 00:49:31,328
He can never touch her again.

410
00:49:51,821 --> 00:49:53,413
You sleep okay?

411
00:49:55,658 --> 00:49:56,920
Yeah.

412
00:49:58,394 --> 00:50:01,557
You look like a man
fixing to do a bad thing.

413
00:50:04,066 --> 00:50:07,524
You know what happens
to men who go looking for blood?

414
00:50:08,104 --> 00:50:10,800
- What?
- They find it.

415
00:50:14,477 --> 00:50:16,604
We all got a choice, son.

416
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:20,080
- Yeah, well, mine got taken.
- Bullshit.

417
00:50:24,086 --> 00:50:26,111
This was my son's jacket.

418
00:50:28,424 --> 00:50:29,823
Try it on.

419
00:50:45,541 --> 00:50:49,170
- Thank you.
- Yep.

420
00:50:50,246 --> 00:50:54,615
You want to take my bike for a spin?
Test the suspension?

421
00:50:55,951 --> 00:50:57,384
'64, huh?

422
00:51:00,222 --> 00:51:01,849
Man, you're heavy.

423
00:51:01,924 --> 00:51:04,188
Yeah, I put on a little weight recently.

424
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,421
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

425
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:11,465
Oh. It fits you beautifully.

426
00:51:13,702 --> 00:51:15,226
I brought you some...

427
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:27,681
Weapon X is in the barn.
He's just murdered two civilians.

428
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:31,151
Blow him to bits.
Let's see if he can survive that.

429
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:56,243
Come get me.

430
00:52:08,524 --> 00:52:10,458
Blow his brains all over the road!

431
00:52:10,526 --> 00:52:11,857
Damn it!

432
00:52:48,197 --> 00:52:50,358
Alpha one, do not lose him!

433
00:52:58,274 --> 00:53:00,742
Alpha two! Target coming to you!

434
00:53:51,594 --> 00:53:52,959
Pull up!

435
00:54:23,959 --> 00:54:26,086
Pull back! Pull back!

436
00:54:44,747 --> 00:54:46,180
Zero?

437
00:54:49,018 --> 00:54:50,645
Zero, come in.

438
00:54:53,889 --> 00:54:55,322
Zero?

439
00:55:01,297 --> 00:55:03,822
- Zero, is Logan dead?
- I don't know.

440
00:55:04,233 --> 00:55:05,666
I'm down.

441
00:55:07,836 --> 00:55:10,168
Zero, is he dead? Is Logan dead?

442
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:16,271
Zero, come in.

443
00:55:20,716 --> 00:55:22,684
You tried to kill me.

444
00:55:23,118 --> 00:55:25,052
- Logan?
- Where's Victor?

445
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,849
Come back to base.

446
00:55:27,356 --> 00:55:29,187
I'll explain everything.
We'll take Victor down together.

447
00:55:29,258 --> 00:55:33,024
Wrong answer.
After I kill Victor, I'm coming for you.

448
00:55:36,231 --> 00:55:37,892
Logan, listen to me.

449
00:55:38,467 --> 00:55:41,868
If you go down this road,
you're not gonna like what you find.

450
00:55:41,937 --> 00:55:45,964
You wanted the animal, Colonel.
You got it.

451
00:55:51,013 --> 00:55:54,972
Those were good people back there.
Innocent people.

452
00:56:05,194 --> 00:56:09,028
It's funny how good, innocent people tend
to die around you.

453
00:56:29,885 --> 00:56:31,944
Zero never stood a chance.

454
00:56:32,321 --> 00:56:36,155
The only thing that'll take him down
is an Adamantium bullet.

455
00:56:43,632 --> 00:56:46,601
This facility's compromised.
Prep transport.

456
00:56:55,544 --> 00:56:57,671
Colonel, this is turning into a disaster.

457
00:56:57,746 --> 00:57:00,340
- Don't worry. We'll stop him.
- Really?

458
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:04,409
You just spent half a billion dollars
making him indestructible.

459
00:57:06,622 --> 00:57:07,748
- Sir?
- Yes?

460
00:57:07,823 --> 00:57:11,623
The young mutant you've been looking for.
We've found him.

461
00:57:11,693 --> 00:57:14,093
General, Logan isn't
the only piece of this puzzle.

462
00:57:14,163 --> 00:57:16,358
I need to evacuate this facility.

463
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:19,924
Please go back to Washington.
We've got work to do.

464
00:57:22,871 --> 00:57:25,669
Yo hablo, I talk. Tû hablas, you talk.

465
00:57:25,741 --> 00:57:28,175
Êl habla... Somebody translate.

466
00:57:29,378 --> 00:57:30,606
Summers!

467
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:33,513
Sit up and take off those glasses.

468
00:57:34,917 --> 00:57:36,578
I have a headache.

469
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:39,651
Then you can wear them
in detention after school

470
00:57:39,721 --> 00:57:42,815
while you write out this conjugation
100 times.

471
00:57:42,891 --> 00:57:44,825
- Somebody else?
- He talks.

472
00:57:44,893 --> 00:57:46,918
Thank you. He talks. Êl habla.

473
00:57:58,507 --> 00:58:00,771
- You sure it was Victor?
- Yeah.

474
00:58:02,411 --> 00:58:04,845
Damn. I'm sorry, man.

475
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:10,743
What the hell happened to him after I left?

476
00:58:10,819 --> 00:58:14,084
He got worse.
He felt like you abandoned him.

477
00:58:14,156 --> 00:58:15,851
Hell, we all did.

478
00:58:16,325 --> 00:58:19,761
But Victor, he had to prove
he was better than you.

479
00:58:19,828 --> 00:58:22,991
Hunting and killing
everything he was pointed at.

480
00:58:23,065 --> 00:58:25,329
Quit a few months later myself.

481
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,732
Couldn't take rounding them up.

482
00:58:28,103 --> 00:58:30,537
- Rounding who up?
- Leave it alone.

483
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,973
Rounding who up, John?

484
00:58:33,575 --> 00:58:35,406
Hey! Damn it, John!

485
00:58:35,477 --> 00:58:37,741
We hunted our own kind, Logan.

486
00:58:38,347 --> 00:58:40,781
There's a special place in hell
for the things we did.

487
00:58:40,849 --> 00:58:43,841
Mutants? Why?

488
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:47,653
Stryker said we'd be making a difference,

489
00:58:47,723 --> 00:58:50,317
protecting people from the bad ones.

490
00:58:58,333 --> 00:59:01,234
How are you gonna take
Victor down, Logan?

491
00:59:01,303 --> 00:59:05,763
- Remember that stuff in Africa?
- Yeah, I remember Africa. What about it?

492
00:59:09,211 --> 00:59:10,371
Damn.

493
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:14,007
What'd they do to you, man?

494
00:59:14,316 --> 00:59:15,749
Don't ask.

495
00:59:17,986 --> 00:59:19,681
Listen, Zero said something
about an island.

496
00:59:19,755 --> 00:59:21,313
Does that mean anything to you?

497
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:23,654
Nope. But maybe Dukes knows.

498
00:59:24,126 --> 00:59:26,720
- Him and Zero were real tight.
- Fred Dukes? Where is he?

499
00:59:26,795 --> 00:59:28,262
- He's here.
- Well, let's go talk to him.

500
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:31,390
Hold on. He don't get in till around 4:.00.

501
00:59:31,466 --> 00:59:34,799
But I got to warn you, he developed
a bit of an eating disorder.

502
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:39,170
We all got our coping mechanisms.
I'm trying to whup him back into shape.

503
00:59:39,241 --> 00:59:41,641
Whatever you do,
don't mention his weight.

504
00:59:42,678 --> 00:59:45,442
Come on, Fred, if you wanna get
in shape, you got to move, man.

505
00:59:45,514 --> 00:59:48,483
I told him he got to move.
He's got to move! What?

506
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:54,248
Fred Dukes? That looks like
the creature that ate Fred Dukes.

507
00:59:54,323 --> 00:59:56,188
Hey, be nice, man.

508
00:59:57,926 --> 00:59:59,894
Hey, fat... Fred.

509
01:00:00,696 --> 01:00:04,598
I seem to remember that girl
when she was about 85 pounds, huh?

510
01:00:05,801 --> 01:00:08,565
Oh, that's funny.
You're still so funny, Logan.

511
01:00:08,637 --> 01:00:10,730
You know where Victor is?

512
01:00:11,607 --> 01:00:14,132
- No idea.
- What's the island, slim?

513
01:00:16,778 --> 01:00:18,678
Don't let the door hit you
on the way out, Logan.

514
01:00:18,747 --> 01:00:21,079
Listen, I ain't leaving here
till you tell me where Victor is.

515
01:00:21,149 --> 01:00:24,050
So come on, bub, for old times' sake, huh?

516
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:28,981
Did you just call me Blob?

517
01:00:30,826 --> 01:00:32,259
No, but...

518
01:00:38,266 --> 01:00:40,894
I told you not to mention his weight.
Why'd you call him Blob?

519
01:00:40,969 --> 01:00:43,403
I didn't call him Blob. I said "bub".

520
01:00:43,472 --> 01:00:45,702
- God damn it.
- Hey, hey, hey. Hey, Logan.

521
01:00:45,774 --> 01:00:47,036
I got an idea.

522
01:00:48,644 --> 01:00:51,135
- This is your idea of an idea?
- I'm trying to help you out, Logan.

523
01:00:51,213 --> 01:00:52,805
Dukes don't like you that much
and you know it.

524
01:00:52,881 --> 01:00:55,145
- Yeah, the feeling's mutual.
- Well, use them gloves, man.

525
01:00:55,217 --> 01:00:59,483
Dance with him a little bit.
Allow him to let his anger out on you.

526
01:00:59,554 --> 01:01:02,580
Figure if you do that, he'll probably
tell you everything you want to know.

527
01:01:02,658 --> 01:01:04,455
Come on, man, look at him.

528
01:01:04,526 --> 01:01:07,256
Got a big old ass coming out
the front of his shirt.

529
01:01:07,329 --> 01:01:09,729
Jesus. He's gonna have a coronary,
for Christ's sake.

530
01:01:09,798 --> 01:01:12,665
Is there even a stretcher big enough
to take this guy out of here?

531
01:01:14,469 --> 01:01:16,767
It ain't him I'm worried about
getting out of here on a stretcher.

532
01:01:16,838 --> 01:01:19,329
- You're an asshole.
- Come on, Logan.

533
01:01:21,543 --> 01:01:23,534
- Whup his ass!
- You want it?

534
01:01:23,612 --> 01:01:25,546
Dance with him, Fred!
Just like I taught you.

535
01:01:26,214 --> 01:01:27,238
You want to dance with me?

536
01:01:27,315 --> 01:01:30,113
- Come on, Fred!
- Oh! Oh, that feels good.

537
01:01:33,355 --> 01:01:35,016
Hey! Guess what?

538
01:01:36,525 --> 01:01:37,822
See, he gonna talk now.

539
01:01:37,893 --> 01:01:40,293
- You got him right where you want him.
- Whose side are you on, anyway?

540
01:01:40,362 --> 01:01:41,829
Come on!

541
01:01:42,464 --> 01:01:44,432
Come on, now, lamb chop!

542
01:02:00,015 --> 01:02:01,209
Damn!

543
01:02:15,831 --> 01:02:17,355
Now, where's Victor?

544
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:51,822
Little dark for sunglasses, don't you think?

545
01:03:07,415 --> 01:03:11,749
- Please, don't! Please, don't!
- Victor!

546
01:03:15,357 --> 01:03:17,723
Hey, hey! Where's Victor?

547
01:03:19,261 --> 01:03:24,631
Yeah. Victor's with Stryker on the island.

548
01:03:24,699 --> 01:03:27,167
They run it together.

549
01:03:28,370 --> 01:03:31,339
What? They what?
Victor will be with Stryker?

550
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,400
Yeah.

551
01:03:34,142 --> 01:03:36,133
You didn't know that?

552
01:03:56,131 --> 01:04:00,568
All that's left now is Logan.
I trust you can handle that.

553
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:05,670
- I did before, didn't I?
- Oh, yes. You did that.

554
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:12,309
Our deal. It still applies, right?

555
01:04:14,649 --> 01:04:17,777
Of course.
Now bag him and tag him, Captain.

556
01:04:26,761 --> 01:04:28,524
What's the island?

557
01:04:29,731 --> 01:04:33,428
It's where Stryker takes
them after Victor's caught them.

558
01:04:34,469 --> 01:04:36,767
Wait, hang on a minute. Takes who?

559
01:04:38,473 --> 01:04:39,804
Mutants.

560
01:04:40,609 --> 01:04:44,739
Rumor is that Stryker's doing
experiments on them there.

561
01:04:47,716 --> 01:04:50,014
I mean, you never wondered
what happened to them?

562
01:04:50,085 --> 01:04:51,848
I tried not to.

563
01:05:08,203 --> 01:05:11,639
They killed her so I'd let them
put Adamantium in me.

564
01:05:14,943 --> 01:05:17,776
They killed her for a goddamn experiment.

565
01:05:21,883 --> 01:05:26,149
- Where is it? Where is it?
- Logan, Stryker kept it real secret.

566
01:05:30,692 --> 01:05:34,719
But a prisoner escaped there once.

567
01:05:34,796 --> 01:05:37,264
- Who?
- His name was Remy LeBeau.

568
01:05:37,332 --> 01:05:39,596
He was a street hustler from New Orleans.

569
01:05:39,668 --> 01:05:42,535
The guards at the prison
called him Gambit

570
01:05:42,604 --> 01:05:43,969
because he kept taking
all their money at poker.

571
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:46,007
- That's all I know.
- What's Stryker up to, Fred?

572
01:05:46,074 --> 01:05:47,837
What's the endgame?

573
01:05:49,844 --> 01:05:54,338
He's taking their powers.
Trying to combine them somehow.

574
01:05:54,416 --> 01:05:57,283
That's all I know, Logan. That's all I know.

575
01:05:57,919 --> 01:06:01,582
If I have to come back here,
I'm gonna take your head off.

576
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:07,521
I'm coming with you, Logan.

577
01:06:08,964 --> 01:06:11,728
- There's no redemption where I'm going.
- I ain't asking.

578
01:06:49,437 --> 01:06:51,166
There's our dude.

579
01:06:57,445 --> 01:06:59,174
That's cool.

580
01:06:59,247 --> 01:07:01,306
I'm gonna go cover the back
in case he rabbits.

581
01:07:01,383 --> 01:07:03,510
- I'm not gonna fight with him.
- Yeah, right.

582
01:07:03,585 --> 01:07:05,644
What? I get in fights with everybody?

583
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:07,847
Don't dogs kill cats?

584
01:07:07,922 --> 01:07:10,390
Just go cover the back, will you?

585
01:07:14,396 --> 01:07:16,887
- Give me 500.
- I'm in.

586
01:07:22,804 --> 01:07:24,567
Are you Remy LeBeau?

587
01:07:26,741 --> 01:07:28,971
- Do I owe you money?
- No.

588
01:07:30,612 --> 01:07:32,512
Then Remy LeBeau I am.

589
01:07:51,132 --> 01:07:53,965
Large blind's 100. Small blind's 50.

590
01:07:54,903 --> 01:07:58,930
- May I deal you in?
- What can I get for 17 bucks?

591
01:08:00,008 --> 01:08:01,305
$17?

592
01:08:02,911 --> 01:08:04,936
A cab ride home, perhaps?

593
01:08:09,484 --> 01:08:12,180
You my brother's new babysitter, John?

594
01:08:13,021 --> 01:08:14,386
I ain't Bradley, Victor.

595
01:08:14,456 --> 01:08:16,549
And your creepy black coat
don't scare me.

596
01:08:16,624 --> 01:08:17,852
Really?

597
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:20,560
Worked on Dukes.

598
01:08:20,628 --> 01:08:22,858
You shouldn't have done that,
'cause now I'm gonna kill you

599
01:08:22,931 --> 01:08:25,058
before Logan even gets a chance.

600
01:08:25,366 --> 01:08:27,926
So what brings you to our fair city, sir?

601
01:08:28,002 --> 01:08:29,560
Victor Creed.

602
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,735
And who's that?

603
01:08:34,442 --> 01:08:35,568
The man I'm gonna kill.

604
01:08:37,345 --> 01:08:40,678
He works with a man named Stryker
on an island.

605
01:08:42,183 --> 01:08:45,675
- Just need to know where it is.
- And why would you think I know that?

606
01:08:45,753 --> 01:08:48,620
Well, 'cause I know who you are, Gambit.

607
01:08:49,724 --> 01:08:54,423
You're the guy who escaped and you're
the guy who's gonna take me back there.

608
01:08:55,497 --> 01:08:59,160
You know, John, there's something
I always wanted to tell you.

609
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:08,266
You're predictable.

610
01:09:11,079 --> 01:09:13,570
I can feel your spine, Johnny Boy.

611
01:09:14,549 --> 01:09:17,279
That's funny. Never knew you had one.

612
01:09:20,889 --> 01:09:24,222
Those are mighty nice tags
you have on there, sir.

613
01:09:25,593 --> 01:09:28,687
The men who took me wore
tags just like them.

614
01:09:32,367 --> 01:09:34,733
Hey, now, bub, you listen to me.

615
01:09:52,353 --> 01:09:54,253
Damn it. That little...

616
01:10:08,069 --> 01:10:11,800
Two years I rotted in that hellhole
and I ain't never going back.

617
01:10:16,077 --> 01:10:17,408
Shiny.

618
01:10:20,081 --> 01:10:22,208
Tell me something, Jimmy.

619
01:10:22,884 --> 01:10:25,284
Do you even know how to kill me?

620
01:10:25,353 --> 01:10:28,083
I'm gonna cut your goddamned head off.

621
01:10:28,756 --> 01:10:30,621
See if that works.

622
01:10:40,235 --> 01:10:42,567
You're getting slow, old man.

623
01:10:51,279 --> 01:10:53,247
You son of a bitch.

624
01:10:56,884 --> 01:10:59,751
You're gonna die for what you did to her.

625
01:11:23,978 --> 01:11:25,240
Victor!

626
01:11:35,189 --> 01:11:37,282
Well, that's a nice stick.

627
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:38,275
Okay, shithead, here's the deal.

628
01:12:38,353 --> 01:12:41,720
See, you're gonna take me to this island,
where I can kill Creed, Stryker

629
01:12:41,789 --> 01:12:45,987
and pretty much everyone you hate
in this world. Do you understand?

630
01:12:46,661 --> 01:12:48,322
You're really gonna kill them?

631
01:12:48,396 --> 01:12:51,194
As long as you stay out of my way, yeah.

632
01:13:05,246 --> 01:13:06,713
Colonel?

633
01:13:07,281 --> 01:13:09,511
- General?
- ls this Weapon Xl?

634
01:13:12,086 --> 01:13:14,987
All their strengths
and none of their weaknesses.

635
01:13:15,056 --> 01:13:16,990
You really hate them, don't you?

636
01:13:17,058 --> 01:13:18,958
No, I don't hate them.

637
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:23,626
After 20 years of working with mutants,
I just know what they can do.

638
01:13:27,535 --> 01:13:31,596
We can win this war before it starts
and save countless lives in the process.

639
01:13:31,672 --> 01:13:35,233
Pre-emptive action is
the only action here, General.

640
01:13:35,309 --> 01:13:39,040
The days of our country
sitting on the sidelines are over.

641
01:13:40,014 --> 01:13:44,075
We need to take the fight to the enemy
before they take the fight to us.

642
01:13:44,152 --> 01:13:46,985
- I admire your passion, I do.
- Thank you.

643
01:13:47,755 --> 01:13:50,053
But this is as far as it goes.

644
01:13:51,058 --> 01:13:54,619
- Weapon X was a hiccup.
- We know about your son, Bill.

645
01:13:55,263 --> 01:13:58,824
We know he's a mutant,
and we know he killed your wife.

646
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:01,960
- You shouldn't have kept that from us.
- That...

647
01:14:03,504 --> 01:14:05,233
That has nothing
to do with my work, General.

648
01:14:05,306 --> 01:14:06,637
Bullshit.

649
01:14:06,941 --> 01:14:10,240
You're too close to this.
I'm shutting you down.

650
01:14:10,978 --> 01:14:15,415
Okay. You're right. I won't lie to you.

651
01:14:18,886 --> 01:14:22,549
My son did bring
the problem home for me,

652
01:14:24,058 --> 01:14:25,821
but I took an oath

653
01:14:27,328 --> 01:14:29,592
to protect the American people

654
01:14:30,698 --> 01:14:33,667
from every threat, both foreign

655
01:14:41,776 --> 01:14:43,437
and domestic.

656
01:14:51,385 --> 01:14:53,216
- You don't like flying, huh?
- I'm fine.

657
01:14:53,287 --> 01:14:54,720
- Just concentrate on what you're doing.
- You sure?

658
01:14:54,789 --> 01:14:56,416
You got a bit of sweat
on your brow there.

659
01:14:56,491 --> 01:14:58,152
Very funny. Just keep your eyes on the...

660
01:14:58,226 --> 01:14:59,989
On the what? The clouds?
Keep my eyes on the clouds?

661
01:15:00,061 --> 01:15:01,653
You're up and down
like a freaking yo-yo here!

662
01:15:01,729 --> 01:15:04,129
- Where'd you get this thing, anyway?
- Oh, this is my baby.

663
01:15:04,198 --> 01:15:06,928
I won her in a game. Jacks over fives.

664
01:15:08,236 --> 01:15:09,498
Great.

665
01:15:10,071 --> 01:15:12,232
Relax. We're almost there.

666
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:19,046
There it is. The island. Three Mile lsland.

667
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:21,548
Hiding in plain sight.

668
01:15:24,085 --> 01:15:27,077
No one's gonna snoop
around a nuclear reactor.

669
01:15:27,154 --> 01:15:29,145
They think it's gonna turn them
into freaks.

670
01:15:29,223 --> 01:15:31,282
- Like you?
- Right.

671
01:15:34,028 --> 01:15:36,758
All right. You ready?
Because it's now or never. Let's go.

672
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:38,264
About time.

673
01:15:47,475 --> 01:15:51,036
Hey, if it makes you feel any better,
this is really gonna hurt.

674
01:15:51,112 --> 01:15:53,910
Well, yeah, it kind of does, actually.

675
01:15:55,116 --> 01:15:58,017
- Good luck.
- Likewise.

676
01:16:00,288 --> 01:16:01,482
Oh, shit.

677
01:16:08,930 --> 01:16:11,455
How you doing? Everything all right?

678
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,525
- Is he ready yet?
- A few more hours.

679
01:16:15,603 --> 01:16:18,834
- And he will respond to my commands?
- Absolutely.

680
01:17:22,536 --> 01:17:23,764
Logan.

681
01:17:25,039 --> 01:17:27,132
Welcome back to the war.

682
01:17:28,142 --> 01:17:31,009
Before I gut you, I want to know why.

683
01:17:32,713 --> 01:17:35,045
I needed your powers for the Pool.

684
01:17:35,116 --> 01:17:37,584
- For the what?
- The mutant killer.

685
01:17:38,519 --> 01:17:40,111
Deadpool.

686
01:17:41,355 --> 01:17:43,323
Years of searching and refining,

687
01:17:43,391 --> 01:17:47,350
finding the right powers
that can coexist in one body

688
01:17:47,428 --> 01:17:49,589
without ripping it apart.

689
01:17:50,765 --> 01:17:53,529
My son was the first piece of the puzzle.

690
01:17:55,369 --> 01:17:57,530
Logan, you were the last.

691
01:17:57,605 --> 01:17:59,835
You made Weapon Xl possible.

692
01:18:00,875 --> 01:18:06,108
I asked you to help,
but you said you wanted the quiet life.

693
01:18:08,215 --> 01:18:09,409
Well,

694
01:18:10,117 --> 01:18:14,986
I've learned that nothing motivates
the men in your family like revenge.

695
01:18:32,573 --> 01:18:34,006
Who are you?

696
01:18:34,875 --> 01:18:37,036
Oh, she's real, old friend.

697
01:18:48,956 --> 01:18:52,187
Did you really think
we'd just let you walk away?

698
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:54,553
You're a dangerous man.

699
01:18:54,628 --> 01:18:57,392
We like to keep an eye on dangerous men.

700
01:18:58,132 --> 01:19:00,532
Tell him about the day you died.

701
01:19:06,407 --> 01:19:09,501
They gave me a shot
of hydrochlorothiazide.

702
01:19:11,579 --> 01:19:15,242
It reduces the heart rate so low
it appears you flatlined.

703
01:19:27,161 --> 01:19:29,186
Don't be angry with her.

704
01:19:30,197 --> 01:19:32,927
She's a real credit to your species.

705
01:19:36,237 --> 01:19:39,695
Did you know that her sister has
diamond-hard skin?

706
01:19:40,541 --> 01:19:43,203
Kayla's mutation is tactohypnosis.

707
01:19:43,844 --> 01:19:46,904
She can influence people
as long as she touches them.

708
01:19:46,981 --> 01:19:49,609
Quite a useful tool in a seduction.

709
01:19:49,683 --> 01:19:52,015
It was never real, my friend.

710
01:19:57,424 --> 01:19:59,324
It was real for me.

711
01:20:01,328 --> 01:20:05,788
I told you if you came down this road,
you wouldn't like what you found.

712
01:20:12,039 --> 01:20:16,840
That story you told me about a man
who gets flowers for the moon,

713
01:20:18,913 --> 01:20:20,744
I had it backwards.

714
01:20:23,951 --> 01:20:27,409
I thought you were the moon
and I was your wolverine.

715
01:20:29,723 --> 01:20:32,419
But you're the trickster, aren't you?

716
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:35,494
I'm just the fool who got played.

717
01:20:37,531 --> 01:20:40,523
The worst part of it is,
I should have known.

718
01:20:43,637 --> 01:20:45,867
But I ignored my instincts.

719
01:20:49,510 --> 01:20:51,740
I ignored what I really am.

720
01:20:56,350 --> 01:20:58,841
But that won't ever happen again.

721
01:21:30,551 --> 01:21:32,485
- Colonel?
- Not now, Kayla.

722
01:21:32,553 --> 01:21:35,078
I've done everything you've asked.

723
01:21:36,557 --> 01:21:37,990
My sister.

724
01:21:38,959 --> 01:21:41,985
You said if I helped you, you'd let her go.

725
01:21:42,062 --> 01:21:46,692
Kayla, it's not as simple as that.
Her mutation is unique. Quite beautiful.

726
01:21:46,767 --> 01:21:48,997
We just need a little more time
to analyze it, that's all.

727
01:21:49,069 --> 01:21:50,696
You let him go?

728
01:21:54,174 --> 01:21:56,540
- Victor, please.
- You can't let him go.

729
01:21:56,610 --> 01:21:58,601
- You can't beat him, Victor.
- Then give me the Adamantium!

730
01:21:58,679 --> 01:22:00,078
- Your tests came back.
- We had a deal!

731
01:22:00,147 --> 01:22:02,809
You would never survive the operation.

732
01:22:04,985 --> 01:22:08,148
- I can take anything he can.
- No, you can't.

733
01:22:08,956 --> 01:22:12,915
You're my favorite soldier, Victor.
Be patient. Your time will come.

734
01:22:12,993 --> 01:22:14,620
He's using us.

735
01:22:23,203 --> 01:22:26,661
How about this time you die for real?

736
01:22:28,275 --> 01:22:29,708
Let me go.

737
01:22:32,313 --> 01:22:34,873
Your little mind games don't work on me.

738
01:22:34,949 --> 01:22:36,280
Victor!

739
01:23:10,617 --> 01:23:12,710
Feels good, doesn't it?

740
01:23:13,954 --> 01:23:15,649
All that rage.

741
01:23:17,391 --> 01:23:20,189
- Do it.
- Logan!

742
01:23:21,528 --> 01:23:25,191
- You're not an animal.
- Oh, yes, you are.

743
01:23:29,269 --> 01:23:30,702
Do it.

744
01:23:34,541 --> 01:23:36,008
Finish it.

745
01:24:00,534 --> 01:24:01,865
Logan?

746
01:24:05,205 --> 01:24:09,039
My sister. They have my sister.

747
01:24:09,543 --> 01:24:12,478
Please. I didn't trick you into loving me.

748
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:15,407
It was real for me, too.

749
01:24:17,985 --> 01:24:21,443
Please, I'm so sorry. They have my sister.

750
01:24:23,023 --> 01:24:24,490
Where is she?

751
01:24:29,963 --> 01:24:32,488
- Activate Weapon XI!
- The bonding process isn't complete.

752
01:24:32,566 --> 01:24:34,193
Just do it! Now!

753
01:25:37,431 --> 01:25:39,160
Come on. Come on!

754
01:26:30,517 --> 01:26:31,643
Okay.

755
01:26:32,686 --> 01:26:33,983
Perfect.

756
01:26:34,054 --> 01:26:35,851
- Kayla, get these kids out of here.
- Logan...

757
01:26:35,923 --> 01:26:37,788
Find another way out.

758
01:26:38,292 --> 01:26:40,419
Okay. Let's go.

759
01:26:41,028 --> 01:26:42,859
Wade, is that you?

760
01:26:46,633 --> 01:26:50,034
Guess Stryker finally figured out
how to shut you up.

761
01:26:52,139 --> 01:26:53,401
Now...

762
01:27:00,647 --> 01:27:01,875
Wade?

763
01:27:02,950 --> 01:27:05,009
You don't have to do this.

764
01:27:05,886 --> 01:27:07,877
All right, maybe you do.

765
01:27:14,828 --> 01:27:16,762
You're shitting me.

766
01:27:22,002 --> 01:27:23,799
Shoot on sight!

767
01:27:31,678 --> 01:27:34,841
- I can help! Point me at them!
- Go.

768
01:27:42,789 --> 01:27:44,347
Go! Now!

769
01:27:50,664 --> 01:27:53,155
- Did I get them?
- Yeah.

770
01:28:03,343 --> 01:28:04,867
- Let's go.
- I can't go.

771
01:28:04,945 --> 01:28:07,573
- Kayla, come on!
- I have to stay here.

772
01:28:08,081 --> 01:28:09,708
You take them.

773
01:28:10,684 --> 01:28:12,879
Go! Go!

774
01:28:40,747 --> 01:28:42,180
Go left.

775
01:28:42,249 --> 01:28:43,443
Left.

776
01:28:44,284 --> 01:28:46,013
- What?
- We go left.

777
01:28:46,086 --> 01:28:48,179
- You can't see.
- Trust me.

778
01:29:02,803 --> 01:29:05,203
Let's see you dance up here.

779
01:29:41,742 --> 01:29:43,767
Nobody kills you but me.

780
01:29:52,552 --> 01:29:54,144
Back to back!

781
01:29:55,889 --> 01:29:58,357
- I got him!
- Oh, no, you don't.

782
01:31:33,687 --> 01:31:35,951
Stop! This can't be the way.

783
01:31:36,022 --> 01:31:37,512
- This is the way.
- How do you know?

784
01:31:37,591 --> 01:31:39,422
I just know. Come on.

785
01:31:50,837 --> 01:31:52,634
Adamantium bullets.

786
01:31:53,273 --> 01:31:56,436
Let's see him heal with
a few of these through his thick skull.

787
01:31:56,510 --> 01:31:59,070
You can't stop him, even with that.

788
01:31:59,446 --> 01:32:01,880
- He'll heal.
- His brain may heal,

789
01:32:03,950 --> 01:32:06,384
but his memories won't grow back.

790
01:32:22,969 --> 01:32:26,234
This doesn't change anything
between us, Victor.

791
01:32:27,507 --> 01:32:30,601
- We're done.
- We can never be done, Jimmy.

792
01:32:31,912 --> 01:32:35,541
We're brothers,
and brothers look out for each other.

793
01:33:09,549 --> 01:33:11,574
- You miss me?
- Ah, Jesus.

794
01:33:13,053 --> 01:33:15,453
You know, when you said
you were gonna kill everyone,

795
01:33:15,522 --> 01:33:18,013
I thought you may
just have been exaggerating.

796
01:33:18,091 --> 01:33:19,524
Yeah.

797
01:33:20,594 --> 01:33:22,721
Do I look like a man who exaggerates?

798
01:33:22,796 --> 01:33:24,787
- You're welcome.
- Logan?

799
01:33:27,267 --> 01:33:28,564
Logan.

800
01:33:32,505 --> 01:33:34,973
There's kids trying to get off the island.
Split up. Go!

801
01:33:35,041 --> 01:33:36,474
I'm on it.

802
01:33:44,417 --> 01:33:46,510
Kayla! Kayla!

803
01:33:50,590 --> 01:33:51,750
Hey.

804
01:33:56,763 --> 01:33:58,230
I love you.

805
01:34:10,610 --> 01:34:12,305
- Hey...
- I'm so cold.

806
01:34:12,379 --> 01:34:15,405
Listen to me.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

807
01:34:15,482 --> 01:34:16,972
Understand?

808
01:34:17,050 --> 01:34:20,315
Just go easy. Nice and easy. That's it.
That's it.

809
01:34:22,722 --> 01:34:25,247
Okay. I'm gonna get you help.

810
01:34:48,648 --> 01:34:50,081
Logan!

811
01:35:46,439 --> 01:35:48,999
I should make you pull the trigger.

812
01:35:49,743 --> 01:35:52,712
But that would make us
no better than you.

813
01:35:53,780 --> 01:35:55,611
Throw the gun away.

814
01:35:58,852 --> 01:36:00,285
Turn around.

815
01:36:00,887 --> 01:36:05,517
Walk until your feet bleed.
And then keep walking.

816
01:36:43,563 --> 01:36:45,394
It will be all right, Scott.

817
01:36:45,465 --> 01:36:48,229
My name is Charles Xavier.

818
01:36:48,301 --> 01:36:50,326
I'm a mutant like you.

819
01:36:50,403 --> 01:36:54,601
- I can hear your thoughts.
- Yes, and I can hear yours.

820
01:36:55,441 --> 01:36:59,343
You're safe now. Come. We have to go.

821
01:37:00,346 --> 01:37:02,246
Come on, let's go.

822
01:37:48,528 --> 01:37:50,223
The kids are safe.

823
01:37:55,568 --> 01:37:56,830
Damn.

824
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:03,266
- Who are you?
- What do you mean, who am l?

825
01:38:03,343 --> 01:38:06,676
I'm the guy who brought you here.
Now, we got to go.

826
01:38:07,413 --> 01:38:09,244
Where the hell am l?

827
01:38:09,315 --> 01:38:11,510
Listen to me. I'm a friend.

828
01:38:11,951 --> 01:38:14,647
- I'm a friend.
- Yeah? What's my name?

829
01:38:14,721 --> 01:38:17,747
- What's my name?
- Your name is Logan.

830
01:38:22,095 --> 01:38:24,723
You need to trust me. We have to go.

831
01:38:30,169 --> 01:38:31,602
Follow me.

832
01:38:37,110 --> 01:38:38,338
Now!

833
01:39:12,045 --> 01:39:13,672
Do you know her?

834
01:39:17,583 --> 01:39:18,914
No.

835
01:39:23,589 --> 01:39:25,716
Hey, these boys aren't gonna like
what you've done to this place.

836
01:39:25,792 --> 01:39:27,726
We really need to go.

837
01:39:28,394 --> 01:39:30,259
I'll find my own way.

838
01:39:35,201 --> 01:39:36,634
Good luck.

839
01:41:07,827 --> 01:41:09,454
Colonel Stryker?

840
01:41:13,766 --> 01:41:17,395
- Colonel William Stryker?
- Yes.

841
01:41:18,604 --> 01:41:20,572
You're wanted for questioning
in connection with the death

842
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:23,131
of General Munson, sir.
