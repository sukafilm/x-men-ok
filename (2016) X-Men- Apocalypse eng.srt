1
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,603
<i>Mutants...</i>

2
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,739
<i>born with extraordinary abilities...</i>

3
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:08,949
<i>and yet, still, they are children
stumbling in the dark...</i>

4
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,784
<i>searching for guidance.</i>

5
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:15,330
<i>A gift can often be a curse.</i>

6
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:20,794
<i>Give someone wings,
and they may fly too close to the sun.</i>

7
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,002
<i>Give them the power of prophecy...</i>

8
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,512
<i>and they may live in fear
of the future.</i>

9
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,265
<i>Give them the greatest
gifts of all...</i>

10
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,685
<i>powers beyond imagination...</i>

11
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:38,183
<i>and they may think they're meant
to rule the world.</i>

12
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:59,958
En Sabah Nur.

13
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,170
Now you will rule for eternity, my lord.

14
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,344
Sleep.

15
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,275
Let the transference begin.

16
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,066
Death to the false god.

17
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,762
Protect him!

18
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,841
As everyone knows, the existence
of mutants was first discovered...

19
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,096
during the Paris Peace Accords,
after the Vietnam War in 1973.

20
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,265
Six days later, we all watched
as one of those mutants...

21
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,519
Erik Lehnsherr, attacked the President...

22
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,231
and the Cabinet on the lawn
of the White House.

23
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:42,364
Their lives were saved
by a young mutant who stopped him.

24
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,572
Now, Lehnsherr escaped and became
the world's most-wanted fugitive.

25
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,328
And as for her,
she disappeared as well.

26
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,660
But she has become the symbol
of a new age...

27
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,246
the face of a world
that will never be the same again.

28
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,082
You winking at my girl?

29
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,329
Your girl?

30
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,458
I guess you do look old enough
to be her father.

31
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,672
Excuse me, gentlemen...

32
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:06,634
is there something you'd like
to share with the rest of the class?

33
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,514
Can I please go to the bathroom?

34
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,266
I think there's something
seriously wrong with my eyes.

35
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:12,348
Fine, Scott.
And afterwards...

36
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,933
why don't you stop by the principal's
office and explain to him...

37
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,393
that you're disrupting <i>class</i> again?

38
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,567
I trust you know the way.

39
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,103
- Yeah, I do.
-Okay.

40
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,898
No, hang on! Hang on!

41
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,739
Hey!

42
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,155
Now, I know most of you were, what?

43
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,039
Around seven years old
at that time?

44
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,963
Summers!

45
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,592
I know you're in here.

46
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,053
What, are you crying?

47
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,351
I haven't even kicked your <i>ass</i> yet.

48
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:57,852
Summers! You want to eyeball my girl?

49
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,487
Yeah!

50
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,156
Ten fights waged.

51
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,699
Ten fights won.

52
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,576
The Winged Warrior.

53
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,578
The Bird of Prey.

54
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:54,988
The Angel of Death.

55
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,573
ANGEL!

56
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:57,998
Yeah!

57
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:06,295
Let's hear it for the fat man!

58
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,256
Our next challenger...

59
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:10,929
comes straight...

60
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:14,258
from the Munich Circus.

61
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,259
Ladies and gentlemen,

62
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,188
the only one that could take on an Angel...

63
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,606
is the Devil himself.

64
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,859
I give you...

65
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,190
the amazing...

66
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:29,231
the fantastic...

67
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,404
NIGHTCRAWLER!

68
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:52,879
Caution

69
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,514
High voltage!

70
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,850
Sorry mutants!

71
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,198
Hey.

72
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,242
Did you get lost little mouse?

73
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,737
The fight is over there.

74
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:20,744
Fight!

75
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,159
Or they'll kill us both!

76
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,838
And it's about to get exciting.

77
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,166
Ah, you mean this?

78
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,946
Nightcrawler!

79
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,029
Nightcrawler! Nightcrawler!

80
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,037
I'm sorry.

81
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,322
I'm sorry!

82
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,163
They went that way!

83
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,087
You can...

84
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:51,998
transform.

85
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,374
You're her.

86
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,793
- The hero.
-I'm nobody.

87
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:55,960
I'm not a hero.

88
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,094
Let's get out of here.

89
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,034
Have a good night, Henryk.

90
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,453
You too, Milosz.

91
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:53,184
Hi Honey.

92
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:54,269
Hi.

93
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,150
Good day?

94
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,488
Better now.

95
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,194
Where's Nina?

96
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,614
Out back. With her friends.

97
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,648
Where did you learn that song, Papa?

98
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,357
I learned it from my parents.

99
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,363
And they learned it from their parents.

100
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,362
And them from theirs.

101
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,664
And one day...

102
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,375
you'll sing it to your children, too.

103
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,374
What happened to them?

104
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:55,754
Your parents.

105
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,377
They were taken from me...

106
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,380
when I was a little boy.

107
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,260
But they're still here.

108
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,265
Inside.

109
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,060
And here.

110
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,392
With you.

111
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:20,067
Is someone going to take you away?

112
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,404
Never.

113
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,417
I guess we're more alike than we thought.

114
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:42,961
He won't listen to us.

115
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:44,929
He's just... He's being...

116
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,179
Scott.

117
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,510
Let me try.

118
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:06,985
<i>Smells pretty old in here.</i>

119
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,695
Is this a school or a museum?

120
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,452
One more. And last one.

121
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,082
There you go.

122
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:15,243
I'll see you guys.

123
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,379
<i>Watch where you're going.</i>

124
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:27,547
I can't.

125
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:29,840
Who are you talking to?

126
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:30,974
Me.

127
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,429
I just heard you in my head.

128
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,019
I'm telepathic. I read minds.

129
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,182
Well, stay out of mine.

130
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:40,351
I don't need some weird girl
creeping around in there.

131
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,021
Don't worry, Scott.
There's not much to see.

132
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,483
Hey, wait.
I didn't tell you my name.

133
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,196
No, you didn't.

134
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,574
Alex Summers?

135
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,663
Hank McCoy!

136
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:55,541
Whoa! What happened to the
big, blue, furry you'?

137
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,498
I keep him under control now.

138
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,413
This is my brother, Scott.

139
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,083
Hey, Scott. I'm Hank McCoy.
I'm one of the teachers here.

140
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,923
Where's the professor?

141
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:10,765
"To break forth bloodily,
then the past must be obliterated...

142
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,385
"and a new start made.

143
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,053
"Let us now start fresh...

144
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,142
"without remembrance...

145
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:21,526
"rather than live forward and backward
at the same time."

146
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,984
Now, what on earth do we think
that the author meant...

147
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,523
when he wrote all that?

148
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:31,448
That's going to be
your assignment for tomorrow.

149
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,784
Top marks, everyone.
Class dismissed.

150
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:35,910
Alex.

151
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,075
-It's good to see you.
-You too.

152
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,664
You look well. It's been a while.

153
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,295
It has. Not too bad yourself.

154
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,501
Thank you.

155
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,256
This is my brother, Scott.

156
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,462
Hello, Scott.
Welcome to the School for the Gifted.

157
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,971
Yeah. It doesn't exactly feel like a gift.

158
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,841
It never does, at first.

159
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,938
The first step in
understanding one's power...

160
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,939
is learning the extent of it.

161
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:04,193
Only then can we begin the process
of teaching you how to control it.

162
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:07,151
If you do decide to stay,
I can promise you...

163
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:11,318
that by the time you're done here,
you'll be able to go back into the world...

164
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,202
and play a stable and productive part in it.

165
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,578
Why don't you take your bandages off...

166
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,286
and we can have a look
at what we're dealing with here?

167
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:20,748
Alex, would you line him up?
Face him in the right direction, as it were.

168
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,378
There's a target just across the water.

169
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,833
When you open your eyes,
try and hit that.

170
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,427
You can open your eyes, Scott.

171
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,300
There's nothing to be afraid of.
It's quite...

172
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,099
Look out! Get back!

173
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,639
Get back! Get back!

174
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,947
My grandfather planted that tree
when he was five years old.

175
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:51,323
I used to swing...

176
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,530
from the branches of it, myself.

177
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,244
I think that was probably
my favorite tree.

178
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,209
Does that mean I'm expelled?

179
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,585
On the contrary.

180
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,121
You're enrolled.

181
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,173
Do you sell rugs?

182
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,509
You're not allowed in this area.

183
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,393
This rug is for sale?

184
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:02,348
I said, this --

185
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,592
Earthquake!

186
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,886
Back to bed, please, my darling.
Back to bed.

187
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,054
She's doing it again.

188
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,097
Back to bed, please, everyone.

189
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,390
Jesse, back to bed, please.

190
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,059
Come on now. Spit-spot, back to bed.

191
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,772
Carrie Anne, come on now. Back to bed.

192
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:12,117
Never seen it like this.

193
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,496
Nor I.

194
00:26:14,615 --> 00:26:16,458
Don't let any of the children
come this way.

195
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,138
Jean.

196
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,627
Jean!

197
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:04,878
Jean!

198
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,471
I saw the end of the world.

199
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:17,561
I could feel...

200
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,892
all this death.

201
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,559
It was just a dream.

202
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,398
No, it felt real.

203
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:26,562
I know.

204
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,191
Your mind is the most powerful
I've ever seen.

205
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:31,650
It can convince itself...

206
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,535
No, no...

207
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,662
It's not just the mind-reading
or the telekinesis...

208
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,323
it's something else.

209
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:43,546
Some dark power inside
and it's growing.

210
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:45,081
Like a fire.

211
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:47,712
I thought I was getting better.

212
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:48,922
You are.

213
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,427
You will.

214
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,258
You just have to be patient.

215
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:55,846
No, no. You don't know what it's like
to be afraid to shut your eyes.

216
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,431
To be trapped inside your own head.

217
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:00,392
Oh, I think I do.

218
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:04,267
It wasn't so long ago that
I was plagued by voices, myself.

219
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,727
All their suffering.

220
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:07,941
All their pain.

221
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,272
Their secrets.

222
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,699
I'm afraid one day
I'm going to hurt someone.

223
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,283
Lie back.

224
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:34,968
Everyone fears that
which they do not understand.

225
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,643
You will learn to control your powers.

226
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,644
And when you do...

227
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:44,147
you'll have nothing to fear.

228
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:48,105
Her nightmares were different this time.

229
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:51,147
It could account for something I saw
when I was in my lab earlier.

230
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,407
There was some kind of tremor.
Like an energy surge.

231
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,158
I picked it up on one of my meters.

232
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:57,445
You're saying Jean created it?

233
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:59,113
No. I'm saying something else did.

234
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,906
Maybe she was reacting to it.
I don't know.

235
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,950
But the epicenter was
halfway around the world.

236
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,242
Halfway around the world?

237
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,661
That's why I was hoping you could
take a look.

238
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,163
Let's see what we can find.

239
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,134
<i>Welcome, Professor.</i>

240
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,851
Okay, the source came from Cairo.

241
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:28,358
I'll put in the coordinates.

242
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,710
<i>I gotta get out of here.</i>

243
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:56,545
<i>Give them a report.</i>

244
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:00,306
What? What is it?

245
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,890
<i>Something happened here.
I can tell them it's real.</i>

246
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:06,388
It's her.

247
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:07,723
Who?

248
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,521
- Moira.
-What?

249
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:11,901
Moira MacTaggert?

250
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:14,233
Give me the details.

251
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:16,319
She looks amazing.
She's barely aged a day.

252
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,070
No. I meant...

253
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:19,693
What is she doing there?

254
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,077
What does the CIA want with this?

255
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,574
She's going back to Langley
to deliver a report.

256
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:26,408
I'm going to go there...

257
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,919
see if she knows something
about the tremor.

258
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,249
And you want to go see Moira.

259
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,547
I want to go check her out.
Check out...

260
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:33,832
the situation.

261
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:38,587
Moira MacTaggert.

262
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,099
It's like a ghost from the past.

263
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,596
You did a good thing.
You saved that man.

264
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,101
That's not the point.

265
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,062
If I'm exposed, we're all exposed.

266
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:52,434
We have to go.

267
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,403
This is our home.

268
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,280
This is our daughter's home.

269
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,362
We are her home.

270
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,950
I told you who I was,
the first night I met you.

271
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:06,119
I trusted you then.

272
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,283
I need you to trust me now.

273
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,462
We can't stay here anymore.

274
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:17,425
I'll get Nina.

275
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,547
Sweetheart.

276
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:34,067
She's not in her room.

277
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,648
And I don't see her out back.

278
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:44,824
Nina?

279
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,238
Nina!

280
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:47,330
Nina!

281
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,414
Nina!

282
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,664
Nina!

283
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:18,024
Nina.

284
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,696
Are you alright?

285
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,232
She's fine.

286
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,566
Then let her go!

287
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:23,821
We will.

288
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,870
We just wanted to have a word

289
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,867
You're not wearing your badges.

290
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,327
No metal.

291
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,836
Some guys at the factory said
they saw something today.

292
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,459
Something that didn't add up.

293
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,135
Put your weapons away.

294
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,633
You've been a good citizen, Henryk...

295
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,053
A good neighbor... a good worker.

296
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,134
I want to believe that's who you are.

297
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:50,309
It is.

298
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,138
But nobody in this town really knows you.

299
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,768
Yes you do.

300
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,434
I am Henryk Gurzsky.

301
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,020
Jakob, I've had dinner in your home...

302
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,193
And you were lying the whole time.

303
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:04,612
I brought a killer into my house.

304
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,329
Is this you?

305
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:16,040
Are you the one they call Magneto?

306
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:38,479
Take me in.

307
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:39,771
Please...

308
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,525
Just let my daughter go.

309
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:53,832
Go with your mother.

310
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,424
Please...!

311
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,336
Don't leave me.

312
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,423
I'm not going to let them take you.

313
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:10,757
Nina.

314
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:13,886
Nina.

315
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:15,804
Nina.

316
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:17,810
What's going on?

317
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,440
She's one of them?

318
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:22,818
Tell her to stop!

319
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,521
She can't control it!

320
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:26,941
She's scared of you!

321
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:29,151
I'm not going to let them take you!

322
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,575
Make her stop!

323
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,038
Nina! Nina!

324
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:03,518
Nina.

325
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,608
Nina, Nina, no...

326
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,898
No, please. Please!

327
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,776
Please.

328
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:13,702
Please.

329
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,504
Not my babies.

330
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,591
Not my babies.

331
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,056
Is this what you want from me?

332
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,435
Is this what I am?

333
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,565
Is this what I am?

334
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:46,348
You know what we do to thieves.

335
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,225
Pick a hand.

336
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,517
Enough.

337
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,355
If you're with her, I suggest you walk away.

338
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:55,983
While you still can.

339
00:37:58,693 --> 00:37:59,660
Walk away

340
00:38:01,196 --> 00:38:05,042
Who rules this world?

341
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,335
What language is that?

342
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,377
Clown-face. What's the deal?

343
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:13,583
Beat it!

344
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:30,726
I'm sorry.

345
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:40,069
You can't feel it, can you?

346
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:55,125
Now you feel it.

347
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:06,394
So you really haven't seen her
in all these years'?

348
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:08,897
You never looked her up?
Not even in Cerebro?

349
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:12,188
Alex! What do you take me for,
some kind of pervert?

350
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,193
Yes, I looked her up once. Twice.

351
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,945
But not in a long time, all right?

352
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:18,323
How did you leave things?
Any hard feelings?

353
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:19,816
Not likely.

354
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,576
Everybody take a break.

355
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,871
I wiped her mind of all memories of us.

356
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,953
The beach, Cuba...

357
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,834
that whole time.

358
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,336
It was so long ago, Alex.

359
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,087
Before the world knew about mutants.

360
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:36,216
I felt it was the best thing for her.

361
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,589
And for you?

362
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:43,090
Didn't really matter
what was best for me.

363
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:48,099
Moira...

364
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:49,979
MacTaggert, hello!

365
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,152
Allow me to introduce myself.

366
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:58,109
- I'm Professor...
-Charles Xavier.

367
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:00,490
- I know exactly who you are.
-You do?

368
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,649
Of course I do.

369
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:04,820
I have read all of your papers.

370
00:40:04,986 --> 00:40:06,988
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

371
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:09,123
Moira MacTaggert.

372
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:10,454
- Alex Summers.
-Have a seat.

373
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:12,290
Just throw that on the floor.

374
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,379
It's wonderful to see you again.

375
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,666
To meet you again, for the first time.

376
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:18,833
You've got a son?

377
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,337
Yes.

378
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,755
Does he have a husband?

379
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,308
Do you have a husband?

380
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:29,435
I had a husband...

381
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:32,017
but it's hard to do this job
and make it home in time for dinner.

382
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,022
Good, good.

383
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:34,603
We all make choices, right?

384
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:37,106
Yes, we do.

385
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,360
- Professor.
-Yes?

386
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:43,282
Yes.

387
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:46,027
I was, we were hoping that you would...

388
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:48,322
tell us about what happened
yesterday in Egypt.

389
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,124
I'm afraid
that's classified information.

390
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,369
I don't mean to be rude...

391
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,541
but how did you get in here?

392
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,873
I have level-five clearance.

393
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:04,213
Ever since the world found out
about mutants in '73...

394
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:07,223
there have been cults
who see them as some kind of...

395
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:09,384
Second Coming or sign of God.

396
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,847
I was tracking one of them.

397
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:15,056
They call themselves Ashir En Sabah Nur...

398
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:18,397
named after an ancient being
they believe to be the world's first.

399
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,856
The world's first what?

400
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,396
The world's first mutant.

401
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,323
I thought mutants didn't evolve
until this century.

402
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,826
That's the common theory, yes,
but these guys believe...

403
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:30,330
that the first mutant was born
tens of thousands of years ago.

404
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,705
And they believe he will rise again.

405
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:35,243
They've been searching ancient sites
all around the world for clues.

406
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:37,749
These hieroglyphs...

407
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:41,883
describe a specific set of powers
greater than any man could possess.

408
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,543
They think he lived all that time?

409
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:46,509
Yes and no.
They believe he had the ability...

410
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,173
to transfer his consciousness
from body to body.

411
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,761
And whenever he was close to death...

412
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,346
he would just take on a new body.

413
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,511
Some of these may have been
the bodies of mutants...

414
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,430
enabling him to take their powers...

415
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,439
amassing various abilities
over the years.

416
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,272
- An all-powerful mutant.
-Exactly.

417
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:03,234
And wherever this being was
he always had four...

418
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:06,240
principle followers.
Disciples.

419
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,276
Protectors he would imbue with powers.

420
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:09,569
Like the Four Horsemen...

421
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:11,951
of the Apocalypse.

422
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:13,706
He got that one from the Bible.

423
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,617
Or the Bible got it from him.

424
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:17,911
And wherever he ruled...

425
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:20,956
eventually, it would end in disaster.

426
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:22,419
Cataclysm.

427
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:24,630
Some kind of...

428
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,260
Apocalypse

429
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,047
The end of the world.

430
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:32,634
<i>I must say, Apollo...</i>

431
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:36,137
<i>the way you ape human behavior
is remarkable.</i>

432
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:43,690
<i>I am Apollo.</i>

433
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:46,774
I've never seen another
mutant in this town.

434
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:48,533
You speak Egyptian?

435
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:49,408
Arabic?

436
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:51,277
English?

437
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:52,991
<i>I'm a scientist.</i>

438
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:54,497
<i>My particular specialty...</i>

439
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:55,656
Great fighter.

440
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:58,914
She's my hero.

441
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,954
I want to be like her.

442
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:06,502
There's some food here. Not much.

443
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:07,759
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

444
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,296
<i>You love me.</i>

445
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:11,172
<i>Love you?</i>

446
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:12,757
<i>Illogical.</i>

447
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:16,845
<i>I'm not some simple shepherdess
you can awe.</i>

448
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:20,477
<i>Why, I could no more love you...</i>

449
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,610
<i>than I could love a new species
of bacteria.</i>

450
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:26,279
What are you doing?

451
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:30,362
Learning.

452
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:41,624
<i>In the streets, there is outrage against
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan...</i>

453
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,121
<i>...in a brotherhood of our kind.</i>

454
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,209
<i>Several demonstrations.</i>

455
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:48,794
<i>One of them was held in Boston,
and Bruce Morton has the story.</i>

456
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,840
<i>Since the advent of nuclear weapons,
the United States does not start fights.</i>

457
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,716
Weapons.

458
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,635
<i>Never before has man
possessed so much power.</i>

459
00:43:57,802 --> 00:44:00,225
<i>Soviet Union and
United States being superpowers...</i>

460
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,817
Superpowers.

461
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:07,403
The weak...

462
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,735
have taken the earth.

463
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:13,447
For this, I was betrayed.

464
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:16,162
False gods.

465
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,077
Idols.

466
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,626
No more.

467
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:29,418
I have returned.

468
00:44:30,126 --> 00:44:32,220
<i>A new tomorrow...</i>

469
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:33,925
<i>that starts today.</i>

470
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,644
Where did you come from?

471
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:50,772
A time before man lost his way.

472
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:55,781
Welcome to the '80s.

473
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:58,784
This world needs to be...

474
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:02,200
Cleansed.

475
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:03,959
What?

476
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:06,413
Saved.

477
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:10,459
You can't save the world...

478
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,593
just going around killing people.

479
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:14,425
There's laws, systems in lace...

480
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:15,713
for that kind of thing.

481
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:19,850
My child...

482
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:22,637
why do you enslave yourself?

483
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:29,068
What are you doing?

484
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:30,820
Making you stronger.

485
00:45:32,188 --> 00:45:34,111
My goddess.

486
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:41,952
<i>Aphrodite.</i>

487
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,249
<i>You were right.</i>

488
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,580
Yes.

489
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:50,756
<i>You were right.</i>

490
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,292
<i>The time is past.</i>

491
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:56,341
<i>There is no room for gods.</i>

492
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,385
Why can't I go with you?

493
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,178
I told you, I work alone.

494
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:12,566
Wait there.

495
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:16,032
Always good to see your face.

496
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,237
Even if it's not yours.

497
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:19,618
Papers and passage for one.

498
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:24,332
Where's the gentleman going,
if I may ask?

499
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,616
Don't know, don't care.

500
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,373
I just save his life.
What he does with it is up to him.

501
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:31,456
Mystique, the mercenary.

502
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:32,874
Don't call me that.

503
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,383
No matter how much you pretend
to be someone else...

504
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:36,010
Caliban knows who you are.

505
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:38,341
If there's anything worth knowing
about mutants...

506
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:40,006
Caliban knows it.

507
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:41,553
mystique.

508
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:43,259
Why don't you ask your psychics...

509
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:45,394
what'll happen to you
if you keep pushing me?

510
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:46,395
What'll happen?

511
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,648
Psylocke gets a little jealous.

512
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,064
But Caliban likes you.

513
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,482
Caliban likes money.

514
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,525
Caliban likes you so much...

515
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:01,865
he wants to give you free information...

516
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:03,996
about an old friend...

517
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:05,623
from back when you had friends.

518
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:08,626
Do you remember...

519
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,832
Erik Lehnsherr?

520
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,122
My girls got a flash of him in Poland.

521
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:15,257
He left quite a few dead bodies
in his wake...

522
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:18,302
including his wife and daughter.

523
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:21,468
Should be in the news soon enough...

524
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,591
but Caliban gives you
a little head start.

525
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:27,436
- How fast are you?
-How fast?

526
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:29,142
How far can you cover?

527
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:30,978
As far as I can see
or if I've been there before.

528
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,483
Come with me, Crawler.

529
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,109
Actually, it's Nightcrawler.

530
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,191
And my real name is...

531
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,361
Kurt Wagner.

532
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,121
The lenses are made of
some ruby quartz I had lying around.

533
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,032
They should be able to
refract your optic beams...

534
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:49,917
and keep them contained
within their own vector fields.

535
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:51,626
Try them on.

536
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:06,975
Okay.

537
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,102
Go ahead.

538
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,972
Wait, sorry, no.

539
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,015
Okay.

540
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:14,104
- Now?
-Yeah, you're good.

541
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:15,267
All right.

542
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:20,356
Whoa.

543
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:23,363
I can see.

544
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:24,743
Thank you.

545
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:27,029
Professor, thank you. You're a genius.

546
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:28,163
No.

547
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:31,037
I'm not a professor.
I wish...

548
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:33,828
Who's that?

549
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:38,337
I believe you two met. That's Jean Grey.

550
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:39,751
You bumped into her when you arrived.

551
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,840
- Wait, that's her?
-Yeah.

552
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:48,100
Hey.

553
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:52,263
You can see.

554
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:56,025
Yeah. It's not <i>as</i> bad <i>as</i> I thought here.

555
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,150
Freak.

556
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:58,652
- Someone should warn the new kid.
-Yeah. Someone should tell him.

557
00:48:58,811 --> 00:49:00,108
They're still scared of me.

558
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:02,364
Hey, I have special glasses now.

559
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:03,820
They're not scared of you.

560
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:05,701
They're scared of me.

561
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:09,622
You're not the only one who
can't fully control your powers.

562
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:11,615
Wait, so...

563
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,535
last night, when the house shook...

564
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,036
that was you?

565
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:18,706
Sorry to break it to you, but you're not
the biggest freak in the school.

566
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,633
Well, that's a first.

567
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:36,857
Raven.

568
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:42,313
Wow.

569
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,399
I... You're...

570
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:46,738
Not blue?

571
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:48,824
Looks like you and I
have that in common, now.

572
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,080
No, no, I meant...

573
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,207
you're back.

574
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,749
Never thought I'd see you here again.

575
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,501
Yeah, me neither.

576
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,211
I'm blue.

577
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:06,841
I'm Kurt.

578
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,256
Oh, right.

579
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:09,590
Kurt Wagner.

580
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:11,433
Welcome.

581
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:16,355
We're closed.

582
00:50:19,892 --> 00:50:21,894
I knew I felt a chill in the air.

583
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:25,944
How did you get in here?

584
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,107
We let ourselves in.

585
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:28,776
We are looking for mutants.

586
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:32,038
Since you know where to find them,
we came here.

587
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:33,573
Caliban doesn't know you.

588
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:37,410
We're looking for the strongest.

589
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:43,082
Everything all right?

590
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:44,466
I'm fine, Psylocke.

591
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:46,969
How much money do you have?

592
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:48,303
None.

593
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,632
Like Caliban said...

594
00:50:51,799 --> 00:50:53,472
we are closed. Yeah?

595
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:57,472
I need your help, my child.

596
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,103
You don't look like Caliban's father.

597
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:02,481
Maybe a little bit up here.

598
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:12,445
You are all my children...

599
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:15,956
and you're lost, because you follow
blind leaders.

600
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:19,126
These false gods...

601
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,996
systems of the weak.

602
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:24,673
They've ruined my world...

603
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:26,132
No more.

604
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:36,685
What do you want?

605
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,022
I want you...

606
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:51,491
to feel the full reach of your power.

607
00:51:57,489 --> 00:52:00,618
You've only had a taste
of your true strength.

608
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,036
Unlike others...

609
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,546
who seek to control you...

610
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:07,383
I want to set you free.

611
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:19,520
I know the kind of mutants
you're looking for.

612
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:24,066
And I know where to find them.

613
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,313
<i>It's my first time in America.</i>

614
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,357
I'm very excited to see your culture.

615
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:33,196
Well, you're not gonna see it here.

616
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,078
The only thing American about this place
is that it used to be British.

617
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:37,742
This is Scott.

618
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,241
He's new here, too.

619
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,909
And I'm already up for a prison break.

620
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,667
What do we say, we take this blue guy
on a little field trip?

621
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,673
I'm sure there's a
mall around here, somewhere.

622
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:50,421
What's a mall?

623
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:52,586
What's a mall?

624
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:55,597
All right, now this is a matter of
national pride. Civic duty.

625
00:52:55,756 --> 00:52:56,848
Scott.

626
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,935
What? You've been cooped up here
for a long time...

627
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,433
and the Professor's not even home.

628
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:04,599
I'd like to go to the mall.

629
00:53:06,934 --> 00:53:08,106
Try it.

630
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:09,064
All right.

631
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,442
Where does he keep his cars?

632
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:28,414
Or should I say "piss off"?

633
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:34,966
This is the guy?

634
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:36,634
He used to be.

635
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:38,891
I didn't know his wings were...

636
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,138
Let's get out of here.

637
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:45,727
His fighting days are done.

638
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:48,230
No, they're not.

639
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,156
What the hell is this?

640
00:53:58,402 --> 00:53:59,995
I want to give you something.

641
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,664
There's nothing you can give me
that I want.

642
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:05,501
Yes, there is.

643
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:22,301
Yes, my son.

644
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,358
Yes.

645
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:52,040
Rise, my angel.

646
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:56,047
Rise.

647
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:26,949
Wow.

648
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:32,922
Hypersonic, blast resistant,
stealth technology.

649
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,377
That's impressive.

650
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:37,217
How are you ever gonna
get it out of here?

651
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:39,586
Well, that's okay.

652
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,630
I built a retractable roof
into the basketball court.

653
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:45,309
Hank, you're building a warplane
down here.

654
00:55:46,218 --> 00:55:48,812
After what happened in Washington,
I thought we were going to come back...

655
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:51,065
and start the X-Men,
like we all used to talk about.

656
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:52,475
But...

657
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:54,609
Charles wants students, not soldiers.

658
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:56,649
And he thinks the best of people.

659
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:57,904
He has hope.

660
00:55:58,272 --> 00:55:59,444
And you?

661
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,742
You know, I think we should
hope for the best.

662
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:05,324
And prepare for the worst.

663
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:07,660
I think the world needs the X-Men.

664
00:56:08,991 --> 00:56:12,586
And maybe now that you're back,
you could help me convince him.

665
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:13,745
We could start it together.

666
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,164
Hank, I'm here about Erik.

667
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,417
Right. Erik.

668
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:19,836
Yeah. Of course.

669
00:56:20,586 --> 00:56:21,428
Of course.

670
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:22,964
I think he might be
in some kind of trouble.

671
00:56:23,672 --> 00:56:24,969
Real trouble.

672
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,101
Isn't he always?

673
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,137
Some of you spoke to the police...

674
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,430
about what you believe
you witnessed here yesterday.

675
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,809
You want to know my powers...

676
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:16,058
know who I am...

677
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:19,652
see what I can do?

678
00:57:21,897 --> 00:57:23,365
I'll show you.

679
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:29,038
Think of the person you love most
in your life.

680
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:32,658
Your wife.

681
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:36,746
Mother.

682
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,341
Daughter.

683
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:49,300
Now that person will know what it is
to lose someone they love.

684
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,849
And live with that pain.

685
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:55,097
Forever.

686
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,727
Henryk, please.

687
00:57:56,932 --> 00:57:58,058
Don't do this.

688
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:01,236
My name isn't Henryk.

689
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,943
My name is Magneto.

690
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:29,924
Who the fuck are you?

691
00:58:32,718 --> 00:58:34,436
Stay back.

692
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:37,264
Whoever you are...

693
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:40,563
don't try to stop me
from killing these men.

694
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:01,789
I'm not here for them.

695
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,337
I'm here for you.

696
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:24,274
Come and see.

697
00:59:57,552 --> 01:00:00,180
This is where your power was born.

698
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:05,147
And this is where
your people were slaughtered.

699
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:22,870
You shouldn't have brought me here.

700
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:26,414
Why?

701
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,878
Are you afraid to be here?

702
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:35,303
You can't escape it, Erik.

703
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:39,052
Who are you?

704
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:42,439
Elohim, Shen, Ra.

705
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:46,477
I've been called many names
over many lifetimes.

706
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:50,113
I am born of death.

707
01:00:50,522 --> 01:00:51,990
I was there to spark...

708
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:55,119
and fan the flame of man's awakening.

709
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:57,700
To spin the wheel of civilization.

710
01:00:57,863 --> 01:00:59,456
And when the forest would grow rank...

711
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:01,787
and needed clearing for new growth...

712
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:06,171
I was there to set it ablaze.

713
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:09,083
Where were you...

714
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:11,718
when my father and mother
were slaughtered in this place?

715
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:12,878
Asleep.

716
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,680
Trapped in darkness.

717
01:01:16,173 --> 01:01:18,141
I was not there for you, my son.

718
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,553
But I am here now.

719
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:24,394
You don't know your own strength,
but I do.

720
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:29,232
Reach down.

721
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,108
Feel the metal...

722
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:33,114
in the ground.

723
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:36,277
Reach as deep <i>as</i> you can.

724
01:01:39,279 --> 01:01:41,532
You'll find you have the power...

725
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:44,577
to move the very Earth itself.

726
01:02:17,609 --> 01:02:21,739
Everything they've built will fall!

727
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:26,623
And from the ashes of their world...

728
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:31,457
we'll build a better one!

729
01:02:57,983 --> 01:03:01,829
Lehnsherr was identified yesterday,
in this small town in central Poland.

730
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:06,329
<i>Leaders from all communities are urging
their citizens to remain calm.</i>

731
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:09,836
<i>As police and armed forces
are mobilizing to find Lehnsherr...</i>

732
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:11,254
<i>...before he can strike again.</i>

733
01:03:11,413 --> 01:03:14,508
<i>If anyone has information
about Lehnsherr...</i>

734
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:16,634
<i>or as he is also known, Magneto...</i>

735
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:19,296
<i>contact your local authorities
immediately...</i>

736
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:21,385
<i>and proceed with caution...</i>

737
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:23,971
<i>-as he is considered extremely...
Peter.</i>

738
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:25,635
What's up?

739
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:30,311
Just checking on you.

740
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,066
I'm good. Playing Pac-Man.

741
01:03:38,106 --> 01:03:39,403
You sure you weren't watching this?

742
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:41,443
<i>This news comes at a time when the world
is celebrating 10 years of peace...</i>

743
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:43,703
<i>between mutants and mankind.</i>

744
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:45,614
You're going after him, aren't you?

745
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:49,418
You wanted me
to get out of the house more, right?

746
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:52,962
I can't stop you. Nobody can.

747
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:55,123
But trust me, this won't end well.

748
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:57,884
Nothing does with him.

749
01:04:01,713 --> 01:04:03,090
I'm not afraid of him.

750
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:05,388
You should be.

751
01:04:31,326 --> 01:04:33,420
I've read so much about this place.

752
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:37,127
But being here,
it actually seems kind of...

753
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:39,384
familiar.

754
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:40,543
Strange.

755
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:41,836
Quite.

756
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:43,129
Shall we?

757
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:46,846
I'm just saying,
<i>Empire</i> is still the best.

758
01:04:47,008 --> 01:04:49,557
It's the most complex,
the most sophisticated...

759
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:51,062
wasn't afraid to have a dark ending.

760
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:52,723
Yeah, but come on.
If it wasn't for the first one...

761
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,391
you wouldn't have any of the rest
of the movies.

762
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:58,061
Well, at least we can all agree,
the third one's always the worst.

763
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,480
Hank. Are you in here?

764
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:02,240
I'd like you to meet...

765
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:05,401
Moira.

766
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,070
Raven.

767
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:08,905
I'm sorry, have we met?

768
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:13,459
Hank, Alex, Agent MacTaggert...

769
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:14,835
would you give us just one moment,
please?

770
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:17,255
Of course.

771
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:23,761
Charles, why didn't she recognize me?
She knew me in this form.

772
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,639
Well, after you
left me on the beach in Cuba...

773
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:29,472
I took her memories of that time.
Have a seat.

774
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:32,016
Lucky girl.

775
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:36,687
It's good to see you, Raven.

776
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:39,144
- Welcome home.
-This isn't my home.

777
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:41,779
It was once.

778
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,781
No, it was your home.
I just lived here.

779
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:46,280
And I barely even recognize it now.

780
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:48,241
You know, I have plans for this place.

781
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:51,205
I mean to turn it into a real campus.

782
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:52,456
A university.

783
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:55,459
Not just for mutants, either,
for humans too.

784
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:57,996
Living and working...

785
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:00,714
growing together.

786
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:02,884
You know, I really believed that once.

787
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:05,841
I really believed we could change them
after DC.

788
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:07,380
We did.

789
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:09,515
No, Charles.
They still hate and fear us.

790
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:11,927
It's just harder to see
because they're more polite about it.

791
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:13,345
I got sick of living that lie.

792
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:16,560
That's why you're not in your
natural blue form.

793
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:19,772
I'm not gonna be the face of a world
that doesn't exist.

794
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:22,566
Things are better.
The world is better.

795
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:24,276
Maybe in Westchester.

796
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:27,067
Out there, mutants are still running...

797
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:29,368
hiding, living in fear.

798
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:32,326
Just because there's not a war,
doesn't mean there's peace.

799
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:34,704
You want to teach your kids something,
teach them that.

800
01:06:34,866 --> 01:06:36,413
Teach them to fight.

801
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:38,544
Otherwise they might as well live
in this house for the rest of their lives.

802
01:06:38,703 --> 01:06:40,876
You still sound just like him.

803
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:42,712
You sound just like Erik.

804
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:46,427
That's why I'm here.

805
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:48,721
He's resurfaced.

806
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:53,184
He had a wife and a child.

807
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:54,560
They were killed.

808
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:57,393
Along with a handful of policemen.

809
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:02,602
The whole world will be looking for him.

810
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:05,318
But you can help me find him
before they do.

811
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:16,826
Moira, I'm going to have to ask you
to keep this a secret.

812
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:20,040
I don't even know what this is.

813
01:07:20,203 --> 01:07:21,671
It's Cerebro.

814
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:22,830
The new model.

815
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:24,670
I based the color on...

816
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:27,961
it doesn't matter.

817
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,442
What are those?

818
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:49,778
Those are all the humans of the world.

819
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:53,953
And these...

820
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:56,490
are all the mutants.

821
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:58,158
I'm connected to all of their minds.

822
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:02,124
The CIA would kill for this.

823
01:08:02,287 --> 01:08:03,914
I know they would.

824
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:08,589
Where are you, Erik?

825
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:41,534
Charles?

826
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:44,083
Hello, old friend.

827
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:49,209
I'm sorry. I am so sorry!

828
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:51,048
I feel your pain.

829
01:08:52,754 --> 01:08:54,347
And your loss.

830
01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:58,343
You think because you can
see into my head...

831
01:08:59,093 --> 01:09:01,095
you know how it feels?

832
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:04,227
<i>You're looking in the wrong place,
Charles.</i>

833
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:07,064
What happened to them,
it was terribly wrong.

834
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:10,230
But come back to us.

835
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:11,943
<i>I can help you.</i>

836
01:09:12,774 --> 01:09:14,492
Help me?

837
01:09:15,443 --> 01:09:16,786
Think of your wife,
think of your daughter.

838
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:18,571
<i>What would they have wanted?</i>

839
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:20,365
They would have wanted to live.

840
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:23,501
<i>I tried your way, Charles.</i>

841
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:27,043
<i>I tried to be like them.</i>

842
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:29,798
Live like them.

843
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:34,429
But it always ends the same way.

844
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:38,762
They took everything away from me.

845
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:43,892
Now...

846
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:49,519
we'll take everything from them.

847
01:09:58,152 --> 01:09:59,153
Hank...

848
01:10:01,698 --> 01:10:03,450
he's not alone.

849
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:12,379
Extraordinary.

850
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:15,590
What do you see?

851
01:10:18,339 --> 01:10:20,091
The answer.

852
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:23,932
Hey, Charles, wait.

853
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:38,693
Oh, my God.

854
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:42,447
Thank you for letting me in.

855
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:49,128
Charles, get out!

856
01:10:50,955 --> 01:10:54,129
I've never felt power like this before.

857
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:55,009
Charles...

858
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:56,420
Charles, get out of there.

859
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:58,179
What's going on? What's happening?

860
01:10:58,337 --> 01:10:59,179
I think...

861
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:01,345
Someone's taken over Cerebro.

862
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:03,430
- They've taken control of it.
-To do what?

863
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:06,513
To connect.

864
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:17,611
Always the same.

865
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:21,699
<i>And now, all this.</i>

866
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:27,332
<i>No more stones.</i>

867
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:32,793
<i>No more spears.</i>

868
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:41,885
<i>No more slings.</i>

869
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:49,893
<i>No more swords.</i>

870
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:52,900
No more weapons!

871
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:56,567
<i>No more systems!</i>

872
01:11:57,396 --> 01:11:59,899
<i>No more!</i>

873
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:03,410
No more superpowers.

874
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:05,993
<i>Charles!</i>

875
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:10,250
Hank!

876
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:29,562
What the hell is going on?

877
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:32,022
Who's turning the keys?

878
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:33,937
The men are.

879
01:12:34,392 --> 01:12:35,689
Who green-lit the launch?

880
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:38,108
Hank, do something!

881
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:44,027
It won't shut down!

882
01:12:46,904 --> 01:12:49,407
We've lost contact
with all Trident and Polaris subs.

883
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:51,750
The Air Force is reporting
the same thing.

884
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:55,209
So much faith in their tools...

885
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:58,045
and their machines.

886
01:12:58,207 --> 01:12:59,550
<i>Russia, China...</i>

887
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:02,428
England, Israel, India.

888
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:04,464
Everybody's got nukes in the air.

889
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:05,631
What's the target?

890
01:13:05,798 --> 01:13:06,890
Where are they going?

891
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:08,926
Up, straight up.

892
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:09,810
Alex...

893
01:13:09,969 --> 01:13:11,266
- What?
-Destroy it!

894
01:13:11,429 --> 01:13:13,397
Destroy everything. Destroy Cerebro!

895
01:13:18,269 --> 01:13:19,395
Wreak havoc!

896
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:26,657
You can fire your arrows...

897
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:29,413
<i>from the Tower of Babel...</i>

898
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:42,502
but you can never strike God!

899
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:02,280
Charles, are you okay?

900
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:21,294
Erik.

901
01:14:24,835 --> 01:14:25,836
Charles!

902
01:14:27,338 --> 01:14:28,214
Alex!

903
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:30,053
Hey!

904
01:14:30,216 --> 01:14:30,967
Hey, asshole!

905
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:33,306
All will be revealed, my child.

906
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:34,186
Stop!

907
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:35,516
No!

908
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:32,731
Wow!

909
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:39,739
Where did you...

910
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:42,533
I was looking for the Professor.
I thought he lived here.

911
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:47,083
They took him.

912
01:17:48,414 --> 01:17:50,132
She's the one. It's her.

913
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:52,251
Are you sure?

914
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:54,461
Is she gonna help us?

915
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:05,598
They look up to you.

916
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:10,527
Right now...

917
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,612
they need you.

918
01:18:16,442 --> 01:18:18,115
That's not what they need.

919
01:18:20,279 --> 01:18:21,531
That's awesome!

920
01:18:29,788 --> 01:18:30,789
What happened?

921
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:32,048
Where's Alex?

922
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:33,292
Where's my brother?

923
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,587
Pretty sure I got everybody.

924
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:40,800
Alex was closest to the blast.

925
01:18:56,815 --> 01:18:57,816
Alex...

926
01:19:19,838 --> 01:19:21,010
<i>We're one click out.</i>

927
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:23,767
<i>All right, boys. This is it.</i>

928
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:28,180
Scott.

929
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:31,851
<i>Medical assistance is on the way.</i>

930
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:35,104
<i>Please remain calm.</i>

931
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:38,366
<i>Medical assistance is on the way.</i>

932
01:19:39,108 --> 01:19:41,361
<i>Please remain calm.</i>

933
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:44,701
<i>Medical assistance is on the way.</i>

934
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:47,203
<i>Please remain calm.</i>

935
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:50,043
<i>Medical assistance is on the way.</i>

936
01:19:53,163 --> 01:19:55,131
Hey! Moira MacTaggert!

937
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:56,884
CIA! Thank God you're here!

938
01:20:03,007 --> 01:20:03,883
Wait!

939
01:20:04,675 --> 01:20:05,471
Fire!

940
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:12,558
I want her.

941
01:20:14,727 --> 01:20:15,569
Him.

942
01:20:17,396 --> 01:20:18,522
Him.

943
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:27,915
- And her.
-Yes, sir.

944
01:20:31,869 --> 01:20:32,870
Leave the kids.

945
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:41,507
- What do we do?
-Keep quiet.

946
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:45,383
X-Ray 7, I'm doing a final sweep
of the ground.

947
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:56,018
Let's get them on the bird!

948
01:20:56,185 --> 01:20:57,186
Clear!

949
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:06,116
Thanks, Jean.
We gotta help them.

950
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:08,451
- Kurt, can you get us in that thing?
-You want to get in there'?

951
01:21:09,073 --> 01:21:10,199
What if the soldiers see us?

952
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:12,039
Don't worry, they won't see us.
Trust me.

953
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:15,253
Hold on.

954
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:33,472
Kurt, get us all out of here!

955
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:36,483
I can't!

956
01:21:36,642 --> 01:21:40,146
When they closed the doors,
there's some kind of electrical field.

957
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:41,564
It's like Berlin all over.

958
01:21:41,772 --> 01:21:43,274
Jean, get in the pilots' heads.
Don't let them take off.

959
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:46,614
I can't. I can't reach the pilots.
I can't reach anyone.

960
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:56,503
<i>We're also getting reports
out of Europe and Asia.</i>

961
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:58,835
<i>This was not just a U.S. phenomenon.</i>

962
01:21:58,997 --> 01:22:03,173
<i>It seems the entire world
has been disarmed of nuclear weapons.</i>

963
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:04,678
<i>The Pentagon has confirmed
multiple launches...</i>

964
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:07,181
<i>from Russia, as well as
the UK, Israel and China.</i>

965
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:08,682
- Look!
-Look up there!

966
01:22:08,841 --> 01:22:11,344
<i>So far, there has been no response
from the White House.</i>

967
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:14,514
<i>Eyewitness reports have been pouring in
from affiliates across the globe.</i>

968
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:18,355
<i>Authorities are not sure
if it was an act of peace or an act of war.</i>

969
01:22:25,315 --> 01:22:27,192
Our dear Father...

970
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:29,786
hold me in the light of God.

971
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:36,376
It should have been me.

972
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:41,006
He was the one that was
gonna do something with his life.

973
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:42,708
He was always the one.

974
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:46,178
That's not how he felt.

975
01:22:47,004 --> 01:22:50,725
He felt you were the one that was gonna
do something special with your life.

976
01:22:51,884 --> 01:22:54,979
That you were gonna
make a difference in the world.

977
01:22:56,138 --> 01:22:58,357
Maybe even change it.

978
01:22:58,891 --> 01:23:01,064
How do you know what he felt?

979
01:23:02,144 --> 01:23:04,397
I know what everybody feels.

980
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:22,461
Hold me in the light of God.

981
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:25,710
Protect me from danger.

982
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:28,883
<i>Save me by Your command.</i>

983
01:23:30,214 --> 01:23:32,091
<i>Listen to my prayer.</i>

984
01:23:33,175 --> 01:23:35,018
<i>And keep me safe.</i>

985
01:24:10,254 --> 01:24:12,552
You're blocking me.

986
01:24:12,714 --> 01:24:13,715
How?

987
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:16,180
I can shield their minds
from your power.

988
01:24:16,343 --> 01:24:19,813
It's one of the many gifts I've acquired
throughout the millennia.

989
01:24:19,972 --> 01:24:22,600
But to see...

990
01:24:22,766 --> 01:24:24,313
inside a mind...

991
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:26,695
to control it...

992
01:24:27,938 --> 01:24:29,485
that's your gift.

993
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:33,194
You saw it, didn't you?

994
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,454
The glory of what's to come.

995
01:24:36,446 --> 01:24:37,698
You're going to take part
in all this killing...

996
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:41,706
and destruction?

997
01:24:42,244 --> 01:24:43,496
It's all I've ever known.

998
01:24:43,662 --> 01:24:45,335
No, it isn't.

999
01:24:45,706 --> 01:24:46,832
You've just forgotten.

1000
01:24:46,999 --> 01:24:48,922
No, Charles, I remember.

1001
01:24:51,253 --> 01:24:52,800
Your way doesn't work.

1002
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:55,970
I've shown him a better way.

1003
01:24:56,133 --> 01:24:57,430
A better world.

1004
01:24:57,593 --> 01:25:00,688
No, you've just tapped into his rage
and pain. That's all you've done.

1005
01:25:01,263 --> 01:25:04,563
I told you from the moment I met you,
there is more to you, Erik.

1006
01:25:04,725 --> 01:25:07,353
There is good in you, too.

1007
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:10,318
Whatever it is you think
you saw in me, Charles...

1008
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:14,322
I buried it...

1009
01:25:14,484 --> 01:25:17,283
with my family.

1010
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:29,753
What?

1011
01:25:30,417 --> 01:25:31,794
What's wrong with you?

1012
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,883
Is that going to happen
to all of us?

1013
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:35,802
No, I just...

1014
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:37,216
left my meds in the house.

1015
01:25:38,175 --> 01:25:39,301
What happened? Where are we?

1016
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:40,310
Hey!

1017
01:25:41,011 --> 01:25:42,012
<i>Hello, Mystique.</i>

1018
01:25:42,262 --> 01:25:43,605
<i>Major Stryker.</i>

1019
01:25:43,764 --> 01:25:44,686
Colonel Stryker.

1020
01:25:44,848 --> 01:25:46,976
I wouldn't get too close to the wall,
if I were you.

1021
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:49,236
<i>It may create some discomfort.</i>

1022
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:51,988
I'm Moira MacTaggert.
I'm a senior officer at the CIA.

1023
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:54,275
<i>I know who you are, Agent MacTaggert.</i>

1024
01:25:54,441 --> 01:25:56,159
You cannot keep me here, in this...

1025
01:25:56,318 --> 01:25:57,535
Actually, I can.

1026
01:25:57,694 --> 01:26:01,619
<i>A psychic event just destroyed
every nuke from here to Moscow.</i>

1027
01:26:01,782 --> 01:26:05,503
<i>That event emanated from exactly
where we found you.</i>

1028
01:26:05,661 --> 01:26:08,130
<i>At the home of the world's
most powerful psychic.</i>

1029
01:26:08,288 --> 01:26:11,212
So, you are going to tell me,
where is Charles Xavier?

1030
01:26:12,751 --> 01:26:14,378
It's not him
you should be worried about.

1031
01:26:14,544 --> 01:26:17,639
There's someone else.
Someone more powerful.

1032
01:26:18,298 --> 01:26:21,393
<i>If you let us out of here,
we can help you.</i>

1033
01:26:22,469 --> 01:26:25,063
Do you really expect me to believe that?

1034
01:26:25,597 --> 01:26:28,271
<i>You can put on any face that you want,
but I know who you are.</i>

1035
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:29,810
<i>What you are.</i>

1036
01:26:35,232 --> 01:26:36,859
Hey, Moira.

1037
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:38,777
What did you mean when you said...

1038
01:26:38,944 --> 01:26:40,821
someone more powerful than Charles?

1039
01:26:43,073 --> 01:26:44,746
Once they finish these,
we'll go from there.

1040
01:26:51,498 --> 01:26:52,920
What's taking so long?

1041
01:26:53,083 --> 01:26:54,209
I can't get in.

1042
01:26:54,376 --> 01:26:57,050
They have a field around it,
like the helicopter.

1043
01:26:57,254 --> 01:26:59,302
There's gotta be a way to cut the power.

1044
01:26:59,464 --> 01:27:00,465
<i>Charles...</i>

1045
01:27:00,841 --> 01:27:02,935
you will send a message...

1046
01:27:03,093 --> 01:27:04,766
to every living mind.

1047
01:27:04,928 --> 01:27:08,683
You will tell them
that this earth will be laid waste.

1048
01:27:08,849 --> 01:27:10,601
That it is I, En Sabah Nur...

1049
01:27:10,767 --> 01:27:12,485
who will wreak this upon them.

1050
01:27:19,151 --> 01:27:20,778
Now...

1051
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:23,948
deliver my message.

1052
01:27:24,114 --> 01:27:25,912
Even if I wanted to...

1053
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:28,577
I couldn't reach that many people.
I don't have Cerebro.

1054
01:27:32,122 --> 01:27:33,590
You don't need a machine...

1055
01:27:33,749 --> 01:27:36,172
to amplify your powers.

1056
01:27:37,043 --> 01:27:39,091
You have me.

1057
01:27:52,142 --> 01:27:54,770
Guys, that could be our way out of here.

1058
01:27:59,149 --> 01:28:00,992
You know him'? Magneto?

1059
01:28:02,569 --> 01:28:03,912
I used to.

1060
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:06,118
Not so sure anymore.

1061
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:08,333
What was he like?

1062
01:28:08,492 --> 01:28:11,496
Was he like they say he was?
Was he...

1063
01:28:13,163 --> 01:28:14,380
the bad guy?

1064
01:28:14,539 --> 01:28:15,631
No.

1065
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:19,720
I mean, yeah. He was...

1066
01:28:21,838 --> 01:28:24,557
Why do you care so much?
You see his speech on TV or something?

1067
01:28:25,008 --> 01:28:27,386
Yeah, but...

1068
01:28:31,556 --> 01:28:33,058
He's my father.

1069
01:28:33,225 --> 01:28:34,351
What?

1070
01:28:34,726 --> 01:28:36,319
- Him and my mom, they did it.
-No, I know--

1071
01:28:36,937 --> 01:28:38,063
Are you sure?

1072
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:41,109
Yeah. He left my mom before I was born.

1073
01:28:41,525 --> 01:28:42,697
I met him 10 years back...

1074
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:44,327
but I didn't know it was him.

1075
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:47,114
By the time I figured it out,
it was too late.

1076
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:49,620
Then, this week I saw him on TV again...

1077
01:28:49,783 --> 01:28:52,286
and I came to that house,
looking for him...

1078
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:54,671
but by the time I got there...

1079
01:28:56,957 --> 01:28:58,254
Late again.

1080
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:02,588
For a guy who moves as fast as me...

1081
01:29:02,754 --> 01:29:04,973
I always seem to be too late.

1082
01:29:05,841 --> 01:29:07,809
Let's hope not this time.

1083
01:29:08,885 --> 01:29:09,727
Yeah.

1084
01:29:09,886 --> 01:29:10,933
Seriously.

1085
01:29:11,096 --> 01:29:12,063
<i>Hear me...</i>

1086
01:29:12,222 --> 01:29:13,895
<i>inhabitants of this world.</i>

1087
01:29:15,267 --> 01:29:16,894
- What <i>is that?
- This is</i> a <i>message.</i>

1088
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:18,607
I think it's the Professor.

1089
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:22,616
<i>A message to every man, woman,
and mutant in the world.</i>

1090
01:29:22,774 --> 01:29:25,618
You have lost your way.

1091
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:28,576
You have lost your way.

1092
01:29:28,738 --> 01:29:30,160
But I have returned.

1093
01:29:31,241 --> 01:29:33,869
But I have returned.

1094
01:29:34,744 --> 01:29:37,338
<i>The day of reckoning is here.</i>

1095
01:29:38,707 --> 01:29:40,425
<i>All your buildings...</i>

1096
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:44,596
...all of your towers and temples...

1097
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:46,639
Will fall.

1098
01:29:46,965 --> 01:29:52,472
And the dawn of a new age will rise.

1099
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:54,272
...for there <i>is</i> nothing you can do...

1100
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:56,649
<i>- Jean.
-...to stop what is coming.</i>

1101
01:29:58,018 --> 01:30:01,397
<i>Jean, if you can hear me,
focus on my voice.</i>

1102
01:30:01,563 --> 01:30:03,941
<i>Cairo.
Find us, Jean.</i>

1103
01:30:04,107 --> 01:30:05,529
<i>Find us. Cairo. Find us.</i>

1104
01:30:06,526 --> 01:30:09,450
<i>This message is for one reason alone.</i>

1105
01:30:09,613 --> 01:30:11,832
To tell the strongest among you...

1106
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:15,961
Those with the greatest power...

1107
01:30:16,119 --> 01:30:19,544
this earth will be yours.

1108
01:30:20,373 --> 01:30:22,546
Those with the greatest power...

1109
01:30:25,545 --> 01:30:27,218
protect those without.

1110
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:33,144
<i>That's</i> my <i>message to the world.</i>

1111
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:39,355
How was Charles doing that
without Cerebro?

1112
01:30:40,101 --> 01:30:42,024
Sir, what was that voice?

1113
01:30:43,104 --> 01:30:44,230
<i>I know that voice.</i>

1114
01:30:44,356 --> 01:30:45,949
<i>It's Xavier, isn't it?
What's going on?</i>

1115
01:30:46,107 --> 01:30:47,825
- We don't know!
-We don't know, bro!

1116
01:30:48,735 --> 01:30:49,827
He just spoke to me.

1117
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:52,080
I think he spoke to everyone.

1118
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:53,660
- I could hear him, too.
-No, no...

1119
01:30:53,823 --> 01:30:55,496
he just sent me a hidden message.

1120
01:30:55,659 --> 01:30:57,161
One he knew only I would hear.

1121
01:30:58,036 --> 01:30:59,083
I know where they are.

1122
01:30:59,829 --> 01:31:00,830
Hey!

1123
01:31:02,248 --> 01:31:04,342
<i>We have shots fired!
Where's it coming from?</i>

1124
01:31:05,835 --> 01:31:07,337
I have intruders in Quad Six.

1125
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:11,432
Send a security team.
Take them out.

1126
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:21,401
The generator. It's worth a shot.

1127
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:23,436
Kurt?

1128
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:47,461
There's some kind of animal in there.

1129
01:31:50,588 --> 01:31:53,057
It's no animal.

1130
01:31:53,758 --> 01:31:54,759
It's a man.

1131
01:31:55,635 --> 01:31:56,636
Who is he?

1132
01:31:58,054 --> 01:32:00,307
That part of him <i>as</i> been taken away.

1133
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:02,726
What do you mean?

1134
01:32:02,892 --> 01:32:06,317
I mean they turned him into
some kind of weapon.

1135
01:32:11,651 --> 01:32:14,120
<i>Charlie Three, report.
Did you find them?</i>

1136
01:32:25,790 --> 01:32:26,791
Shut it down.

1137
01:32:50,774 --> 01:32:51,650
Fire!

1138
01:33:02,452 --> 01:33:03,954
Weapon X is loose!

1139
01:33:04,496 --> 01:33:06,919
I repeat, Weapon X is loose!

1140
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:10,881
You sure he's not an animal?

1141
01:33:15,715 --> 01:33:18,844
<i>- He's into the</i> central halls.
<i>- Engaging target Sector Five.</i>

1142
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:20,436
<i>We can't...</i>

1143
01:33:36,861 --> 01:33:37,862
Hey!

1144
01:33:58,591 --> 01:34:00,138
- What are they doing?
-What's going on?

1145
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:02,645
<i>- I just lost feed.
-Hey! What's going on here?</i>

1146
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:05,644
I'll be right back.

1147
01:34:08,852 --> 01:34:09,899
No!

1148
01:34:26,786 --> 01:34:29,539
Hey! Stay where you are!

1149
01:34:48,808 --> 01:34:49,730

<i>Logan.</i>

1153

What'd you do to him?

1154
01:36:32,453 --> 01:36:36,003
I found a piece of his past
and gave it back to him.

1155
01:36:36,332 --> 01:36:38,710
Just the few memories I could reach.

1156
01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:42,972
I hope that's the last we've seen
of that guy.

1157
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:03,401
Kurt.

1158
01:37:06,195 --> 01:37:07,538
- What?
-What?

1159
01:37:07,697 --> 01:37:08,698
Hey.

1160
01:37:13,745 --> 01:37:16,089

01:37:16,247 --> 01:37:17,123
The what?

1162
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:18,757
The do-...

1163
01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:20,088
<i>Stay away from the...</i>

1164
01:37:20,251 --> 01:37:21,377
Get away from the door!

1165
01:37:21,544 --> 01:37:22,545
<i>On three.</i>

1166
01:37:22,712 --> 01:37:24,931
One... two...

1167
01:37:37,935 --> 01:37:39,437
We know where the Professor is.

1168
01:37:39,604 --> 01:37:40,947
I think we might have a way out of here.

1169
01:37:41,105 --> 01:37:44,029
- Well, you've been busy.
-We had a little help.

1170
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:45,860
Let's go!

1171
01:37:49,364 --> 01:37:50,365
Jesus!

1172
01:37:50,531 --> 01:37:51,532
Oh, sorry!

1173
01:37:51,699 --> 01:37:52,871
This way!

1174
01:38:02,293 --> 01:38:04,796
This was meant to be
the center of the universe...

1175
01:38:04,962 --> 01:38:06,714
before I was betrayed.

1176
01:38:06,881 --> 01:38:08,474
Now...

1177
01:38:08,633 --> 01:38:09,976
it will be.

1178
01:39:30,715 --> 01:39:31,841
Nice.

1179
01:39:32,633 --> 01:39:35,352
Hey, Hank, do you think
you can fly this thing?

1180
01:39:35,803 --> 01:39:37,646
Yeah, I can figure it out.

1181
01:39:39,015 --> 01:39:39,857
Hey, guys.

1182
01:39:41,309 --> 01:39:42,856
Flight suits.

1183
01:39:46,689 --> 01:39:48,691
You got your warplane.

1184
01:39:48,858 --> 01:39:50,235
Let's go to war.

1185
01:39:57,492 --> 01:39:59,244
A gift...

1186
01:39:59,410 --> 01:40:01,333
from the past you left behind...

1187
01:40:02,538 --> 01:40:05,257
and the future that lies ahead.

1188
01:40:06,667 --> 01:40:10,171
You will reach down, my son.

1189
01:40:10,338 --> 01:40:12,466
Deep into the earth.

1190
01:40:12,632 --> 01:40:15,886
Rip everything they've
built from the ground.

1191
01:40:16,052 --> 01:40:18,646
Wipe clean this world.

1192
01:40:18,804 --> 01:40:22,354
And we will lead those that survive...

1193
01:40:22,517 --> 01:40:25,316
into a better one.

1194
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:27,275
And me?

1195
01:40:28,439 --> 01:40:31,033
Am I to play a role in this madness?

1196
01:40:32,735 --> 01:40:36,365
You have the most important role of all.

1197
01:40:47,667 --> 01:40:49,385
Were you scared?

1198
01:40:49,877 --> 01:40:51,845
That day in D.C., were you scared?

1199
01:40:52,004 --> 01:40:52,846
No.

1200
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:01,894
But I was scared on my first mission.

1201
01:41:02,265 --> 01:41:04,313
I was on a plane like this
with my friends.

1202
01:41:04,725 --> 01:41:06,068
About your age.

1203
01:41:09,689 --> 01:41:11,942
We called ourselves the X-Men.

1204
01:41:13,401 --> 01:41:14,903
Your brother was there.

1205
01:41:15,444 --> 01:41:16,821
We used to call him Havok.

1206
01:41:17,363 --> 01:41:19,286
He was a real handful...

1207
01:41:21,242 --> 01:41:23,836
but when it came down to it,
he was very brave.

1208
01:41:26,163 --> 01:41:28,837
What happened to the rest of the kids
who went with you'?

1209
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,172
The X-Men?

1210
01:41:32,962 --> 01:41:34,760
Hank and I are the only ones left.

1211
01:41:35,881 --> 01:41:37,724
I couldn't save the rest of them.

1212
01:41:38,718 --> 01:41:40,720
I told you, I'm not a hero.

1213
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:43,097
Well, you're a hero to us.

1214
01:41:43,806 --> 01:41:45,558
Seeing you that day on

1215
01:41:45,725 --> 01:41:46,977
changed my life.

1216
01:41:47,518 --> 01:41:48,610
Mine, too.

1217
01:41:49,645 --> 01:41:50,646
Mine, too.

1218
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:56,073
I still live in my mom's basement
but, you know...

1219
01:41:56,235 --> 01:41:57,908
everything else is...

1220
01:41:59,655 --> 01:42:01,578
It's pretty much the same.

1221
01:42:03,451 --> 01:42:04,828
I'm a total loser.

1222
01:43:04,970 --> 01:43:07,268
What we're seeing is
a magnetic phenomenon...

1223
01:43:07,431 --> 01:43:10,025
on a much larger scale
than what we saw at Auschwitz.

1224
01:43:10,309 --> 01:43:12,732
The ground is full of magnetic elements.

1225
01:43:12,895 --> 01:43:14,522
Iron, nickel, cobalt.

1226
01:43:14,689 --> 01:43:17,067
The ocean's floor
is lined with them, too.

1227
01:43:17,233 --> 01:43:19,907
It's already begun at the lowest depths.

1228
01:43:20,069 --> 01:43:23,198
Land <i>masses</i> will slow it,
but not for long.

1229
01:43:23,364 --> 01:43:26,208
Eventually, cities, urban centers...

1230
01:43:26,367 --> 01:43:28,620
anything built since the Bronze Age...

1231
01:43:28,786 --> 01:43:30,083
will be wiped away.

1232
01:43:30,246 --> 01:43:31,668
The death toll will be in the billions.

1233
01:43:31,831 --> 01:43:34,209
He's talking about
the whole goddamn world.

1234
01:44:23,549 --> 01:44:24,801
You're just another false god.

1235
01:44:25,843 --> 01:44:28,141
And whoever's left to follow you
when this all over...

1236
01:44:28,304 --> 01:44:31,399
they will betray you again.

1237
01:44:33,601 --> 01:44:35,524
You're wrong, Charles.

1238
01:44:35,936 --> 01:44:39,531
For the first time
in a thousand lifetimes...

1239
01:44:39,690 --> 01:44:41,192
I have you.

1240
01:44:41,692 --> 01:44:47,290
For all my gifts, I have yet
to possess the one I needed most.

1241
01:44:47,948 --> 01:44:49,165
To be...

1242
01:44:49,909 --> 01:44:51,832
everywhere.

1243
01:44:54,872 --> 01:44:56,044
To be...

1244
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:58,084
everyone.

1245
01:45:13,891 --> 01:45:15,814
Seventh wonder, twelve 0' clock.

1246
01:45:24,068 --> 01:45:26,070
He has the Professor
in the center of the pyramid.

1247
01:45:27,238 --> 01:45:30,617
He's going to transfer his consciousness
into the Professor.

1248
01:45:30,783 --> 01:45:31,579
If he does that...

1249
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:35,129
he'll have the power
to control every mind in the world.

1250
01:45:42,169 --> 01:45:44,342
What the hell is that?

1251
01:45:45,256 --> 01:45:46,428
It's Erik.

1252
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:58,318
You guys help Nightcrawler
get into the pyramid.

1253
01:46:00,271 --> 01:46:02,820
Get Charles. I'll take care of Erik.

1254
01:46:02,982 --> 01:46:04,780
How are we gonna get through that?

1255
01:46:05,609 --> 01:46:06,781
I can get you in there.

1256
01:46:07,444 --> 01:46:08,991
I came here for him. Let me help you.

1257
01:46:10,364 --> 01:46:12,958
The rest of you, get Charles on this
plane and get him out of here.

1258
01:46:13,117 --> 01:46:14,835
- We're not leaving without you!
-Don't worry.

1259
01:46:15,703 --> 01:46:16,670
We'll catch up.

1260
01:46:16,954 --> 01:46:18,046
Hold on.

1261
01:46:48,652 --> 01:46:49,869
Hank, you go with the kids.

1262
01:46:50,029 --> 01:46:52,327
- Moira will be waiting on the plane.
-Wait.

1263
01:46:52,656 --> 01:46:53,657
What?

1264
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:56,168
Not all of us can
fully control our powers.

1265
01:46:56,660 --> 01:46:58,003
Then don't.

1266
01:46:58,329 --> 01:47:00,002
You need to embrace them.

1267
01:47:03,334 --> 01:47:04,426
We all do.

1268
01:47:28,442 --> 01:47:31,366
Go. Join the others.

1269
01:47:31,528 --> 01:47:34,702
Protect me,
until the transference is complete.

1270
01:47:59,890 --> 01:48:01,392
There's an entrance. It's clear.

1271
01:48:05,729 --> 01:48:07,322
Kurt! Get in there!

1272
01:48:18,242 --> 01:48:19,585
In the pyramid! Move!

1273
01:48:20,327 --> 01:48:21,328
Go!

1274
01:48:57,823 --> 01:48:58,949
Split them up.

1275
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:23,640
Professor...

1276
01:49:27,644 --> 01:49:28,816
Kurt, you have to hurry!

1277
01:49:28,979 --> 01:49:31,152
I'm trying. It's like a maze in here.

1278
01:49:41,492 --> 01:49:42,493
Kurt, no!

1279
01:50:08,018 --> 01:50:09,861
The magnetic field is too strong.
I can't get us in there.

1280
01:50:12,856 --> 01:50:13,948
Erik!

1281
01:50:21,198 --> 01:50:22,199
mystique.

1282
01:50:26,537 --> 01:50:29,461
I know you think you've lost everything.

1283
01:50:30,249 --> 01:50:31,717
But you haven't.

1284
01:50:33,293 --> 01:50:35,387
You have me.

1285
01:50:35,712 --> 01:50:37,464
You have Charles.

1286
01:50:43,554 --> 01:50:46,228
You have more family than you know.

1287
01:50:47,391 --> 01:50:50,065
You never had the chance
to save your family before.

1288
01:50:51,228 --> 01:50:52,901
But you do now.

1289
01:50:55,566 --> 01:50:58,069
That's what I've come here to tell you.

1290
01:51:03,448 --> 01:51:05,075
And you?

1291
01:51:13,917 --> 01:51:15,590
I'm your...

1292
01:51:19,923 --> 01:51:22,267
I'm here for my family, too.

1293
01:52:11,516 --> 01:52:13,359
Get out. Get out!

1294
01:52:13,518 --> 01:52:14,815
Get out!

1295
01:52:21,693 --> 01:52:23,161
<i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

1296
01:52:34,748 --> 01:52:36,170
We're losing him.

1297
01:52:52,349 --> 01:52:53,271
I'll be right back.

1298
01:53:04,403 --> 01:53:05,700
Scott, glasses on!

1299
01:53:15,706 --> 01:53:16,548
Let's go!

1300
01:53:33,557 --> 01:53:35,059
- Locked on.
-Here we go.

1301
01:53:52,909 --> 01:53:54,081
Psylocke!

1302
01:54:10,427 --> 01:54:11,644
What the hell was that?

1303
01:54:18,310 --> 01:54:19,436
Kurt.

1304
01:54:19,770 --> 01:54:20,987
Everyone, grab hold of Nightcrawler!

1305
01:54:21,271 --> 01:54:22,614
I've never done it
with this many people.

1306
01:54:22,773 --> 01:54:23,615
Get us out of here.

1307
01:54:39,623 --> 01:54:40,795
Kurt, hurry!

1308
01:54:42,376 --> 01:54:43,298
Kurt!

1309
01:55:09,403 --> 01:55:10,905
Charles...

1310
01:55:16,326 --> 01:55:17,168
Is he okay?

1311
01:55:17,828 --> 01:55:20,081
It's his energy. He's drained.

1312
01:55:21,498 --> 01:55:22,499
Get out.

1313
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:24,342
Get out!

1314
01:55:24,501 --> 01:55:26,845
Professor, it's okay.
You're with us.

1315
01:55:27,921 --> 01:55:29,343
It's okay.

1316
01:55:38,014 --> 01:55:40,642
I'm going to fight
for what I have left.

1317
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:45,988
Are you?

1318
01:55:58,827 --> 01:56:01,330
There's so much more to you
than you know.

1319
01:56:01,496 --> 01:56:04,466
Not just pain and anger.

1320
01:56:04,624 --> 01:56:06,501
There's good, too. I felt it.

1321
01:56:07,002 --> 01:56:08,879
It's not just me
you're walking away from.

1322
01:56:09,045 --> 01:56:13,221
Here, you have the chance to be a part of
something much bigger than yourself.

1323
01:56:13,383 --> 01:56:16,227
And it needs you, Erik.

1324
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:47,168
Useless.

1325
01:56:52,506 --> 01:56:53,849
<i>Charles.</i>

1326
01:56:56,092 --> 01:56:58,220
I know you can hear me.

1327
01:56:59,095 --> 01:57:02,099
We're still connected.

1328
01:57:05,894 --> 01:57:06,895
Charles!

1329
01:57:08,021 --> 01:57:09,443
Show yourself!

1330
01:57:11,066 --> 01:57:12,613
Charles!

1331
01:57:13,401 --> 01:57:15,620
Show yourself!

1332
01:57:45,225 --> 01:57:47,102
Foolish child.

1333
01:57:55,777 --> 01:57:56,744
Peter.

1334
01:58:13,837 --> 01:58:14,838
End him.

1335
01:58:41,531 --> 01:58:42,532
Raven.

1336
01:58:50,832 --> 01:58:52,209
The great hero.

1337
01:58:57,297 --> 01:58:59,516
- I'm going out there.
-I'm going with you.

1338
01:58:59,674 --> 01:59:00,891
No.

1339
01:59:02,093 --> 01:59:03,310
It's me he wants.

1340
01:59:03,470 --> 01:59:04,596
Charles, you can't give yourself up.

1341
01:59:05,180 --> 01:59:07,057
If he has you, he has us all.

1342
01:59:07,223 --> 01:59:08,850
The whole world.

1343
01:59:09,017 --> 01:59:10,769
You are feeble.

1344
01:59:10,935 --> 01:59:11,982
Just like the others.

1345
01:59:13,188 --> 01:59:14,189
Charles!

1346
01:59:14,356 --> 01:59:15,198
Come!

1347
01:59:15,357 --> 01:59:16,984
Rescue your weaklings!

1348
01:59:18,360 --> 01:59:20,203
Give your life for theirs!

1349
01:59:22,238 --> 01:59:23,239
No.

1350
01:59:31,373 --> 01:59:32,420
He was right.

1351
01:59:33,541 --> 01:59:36,044
There is still some part of me
connected to him.

1352
01:59:37,003 --> 01:59:37,799
Charles!

1353
01:59:37,962 --> 01:59:39,555
I can get inside his head.

1354
01:59:39,714 --> 01:59:41,637
Will you do nothing?

1355
01:59:43,051 --> 01:59:44,803
Thank you for letting me in.

1356
02:00:02,946 --> 02:00:04,493
You want what I have?

1357
02:00:04,656 --> 02:00:06,829
You want to feel what I feel?

1358
02:00:18,628 --> 02:00:19,971
Welcome to my world!

1359
02:00:22,632 --> 02:00:23,633
You're in my house now!

1360
02:00:34,060 --> 02:00:36,062
You'll need a bigger house.

1361
02:01:55,475 --> 02:01:57,068
You betray me?

1362
02:01:57,227 --> 02:01:58,228
No.

1363
02:01:59,145 --> 02:02:00,647
I betrayed them.

1364
02:02:28,925 --> 02:02:30,017
Let's jump.

1365
02:02:30,176 --> 02:02:31,018
What?

1366
02:02:36,432 --> 02:02:37,433
Cover me.

1367
02:02:39,894 --> 02:02:41,396
I got you.

1368
02:02:46,568 --> 02:02:47,785
Come on!

1369
02:03:09,048 --> 02:03:11,642
They lack strength, Charles.

1370
02:03:17,807 --> 02:03:19,104
Jean.

1371
02:03:24,772 --> 02:03:26,069
Come here.

1372
02:03:38,453 --> 02:03:39,750
Help...

1373
02:03:42,248 --> 02:03:43,591
me.

1374
02:03:48,463 --> 02:03:49,840
Stay here.

1375
02:03:59,140 --> 02:04:00,767
They can't stop him.

1376
02:04:01,434 --> 02:04:02,606
Jean.

1377
02:04:05,021 --> 02:04:07,240
Help me!

1378
02:04:30,296 --> 02:04:31,422
Hank!

1379
02:04:32,674 --> 02:04:33,470
Hank!

1380
02:04:40,932 --> 02:04:43,902
It's over, Charles.
You're finished.

1381
02:04:44,060 --> 02:04:45,653
You're mine now.

1382
02:04:48,064 --> 02:04:50,738
You will never win.

1383
02:04:51,192 --> 02:04:53,115
And why is that?

1384
02:04:53,277 --> 02:04:55,405
Because you are alone.

1385
02:04:57,281 --> 02:05:00,626
And I am not!

1386
02:05:12,672 --> 02:05:13,844
<i>Let...</i>

1387
02:05:14,298 --> 02:05:15,675
go.

1388
02:05:16,300 --> 02:05:18,098
<i>Unleash your power, Jean.</i>

1389
02:05:19,554 --> 02:05:20,851
No fear.

1390
02:06:08,978 --> 02:06:11,197
Unleash your power!

1391
02:06:11,647 --> 02:06:13,365
Let go, Jean!

1392
02:06:13,816 --> 02:06:15,784
Jean, let go!

1393
02:06:51,604 --> 02:06:53,231
He's getting away.

1394
02:07:10,748 --> 02:07:14,378
All is revealed.

1395
02:08:16,189 --> 02:08:17,941
Charles! Charles!

1396
02:08:19,442 --> 02:08:20,443
- We've lost him!
-Charles.

1397
02:08:20,610 --> 02:08:22,283
- He's gone.
-No, Charles.

1398
02:08:22,445 --> 02:08:23,446
Charles...

1399
02:08:23,946 --> 02:08:25,118
No, he's not.

1400
02:08:26,532 --> 02:08:27,784
I can still feel him.

1401
02:08:51,974 --> 02:08:53,647
Thank you, Jean.

1402
02:08:55,728 --> 02:08:56,729
Charles?

1403
02:08:57,730 --> 02:08:59,357
Charles, do you know where you are?

1404
02:09:02,818 --> 02:09:04,491
I'm on a beach.

1405
02:09:10,576 --> 02:09:12,249
In Cuba.

1406
02:09:13,996 --> 02:09:15,418
With you.

1407
02:09:15,831 --> 02:09:17,333
What beach?

1408
02:09:24,882 --> 02:09:25,678
Charles Xavier.

1409
02:09:52,785 --> 02:09:53,877
I'm sorry.

1410
02:09:54,870 --> 02:09:57,214
I should never have taken those
from you.

1411
02:10:00,626 --> 02:10:01,752
Hold on!

1412
02:10:06,757 --> 02:10:08,054
What did I miss?

1413
02:10:10,928 --> 02:10:13,397
<i>It seems only by the grace of God...</i>

1414
02:10:13,556 --> 02:10:14,773
<i>that the ominous destruction...</i>

1415
02:10:14,932 --> 02:10:17,776
<i>seen from one end of the globe
to the other, has stopped.</i>

1416
02:10:17,935 --> 02:10:20,313
<i>At a debriefing today,
CIA Special Agent Moira MacTaggert...</i>

1417
02:10:20,479 --> 02:10:22,652
<i>revealed to an investigative
committee...</i>

1418
02:10:22,815 --> 02:10:25,785
<i>The committee was further stunned
to learn that fugitive Erik Lehnsherr...</i>

1419
02:10:25,943 --> 02:10:28,162
<i>aided in defeating
this powerful and unknown...</i>

1420
02:10:28,321 --> 02:10:30,665
I think our prayers were answered.

1421
02:10:31,407 --> 02:10:32,829
Thank you, Mr. President.

1422
02:10:32,992 --> 02:10:34,494
<i>The potential destructive power
of mutants...</i>

1423
02:10:34,660 --> 02:10:36,754
<i>...is sure to fuel new controversy
and debate...</i>

1424
02:10:36,912 --> 02:10:40,633
<i>at a time when mutants were becoming
accepted around the world.</i>

1425
02:11:07,777 --> 02:11:10,200
Mystique told me he is your father.

1426
02:11:11,322 --> 02:11:13,370
Are you gonna tell him?

1427
02:11:14,617 --> 02:11:15,618
I might...

1428
02:11:16,535 --> 02:11:17,707
one day.

1429
02:11:19,288 --> 02:11:22,212
I think for now, I'm just gonna
stick around here for a while.

1430
02:11:27,963 --> 02:11:29,135
Me, too.

1431
02:11:40,226 --> 02:11:43,230
The world's already begun
rebuilding its arsenals.

1432
02:11:43,854 --> 02:11:46,152
It's human nature, Charles.

1433
02:11:47,858 --> 02:11:49,201
I still have hope.

1434
02:11:50,486 --> 02:11:51,487
Oh, yes.

1435
02:11:52,905 --> 02:11:53,997
"Hope."

1436
02:11:54,824 --> 02:11:56,667
I was right about Raven.

1437
02:11:57,410 --> 02:11:59,083
I was even right about you.

1438
02:12:02,581 --> 02:12:04,083
What about the rest of the world?

1439
02:12:06,001 --> 02:12:08,720
Doesn't it ever wake you up
in the middle of the night?

1440
02:12:10,881 --> 02:12:13,930
The feeling that one day
they'll come for you...

1441
02:12:14,093 --> 02:12:16,187
and your children.

1442
02:12:17,596 --> 02:12:19,348
It does, indeed.

1443
02:12:19,515 --> 02:12:22,359
What do you do when you wake up to that?

1444
02:12:23,561 --> 02:12:26,030
I feel a great swell of pity
for the poor soul...

1445
02:12:26,188 --> 02:12:29,533
that comes to my school
looking for trouble.

1446
02:12:34,530 --> 02:12:36,749
You're sure I can't convince you
to stay?

1447
02:12:38,409 --> 02:12:40,207
You're psychic, Charles.

1448
02:12:40,703 --> 02:12:42,580
You can convince me to do anything.

1449
02:12:45,374 --> 02:12:47,047
Goodbye, old friend.

1450
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:49,553
Good luck, Professor.

1451
02:12:54,967 --> 02:12:56,389
Forget everything you think you know.

1452
02:12:58,387 --> 02:13:00,765
Whatever <i>lessons</i> you learned
in school...

1453
02:13:02,141 --> 02:13:04,064
whatever your parents taught you.

1454
02:13:05,561 --> 02:13:08,405
None of that matters!

1455
02:13:09,899 --> 02:13:11,742
You're not kids anymore.

1456
02:13:12,318 --> 02:13:13,945
You're not students.

1457
02:13:18,073 --> 02:13:19,495
You're X-Men.
