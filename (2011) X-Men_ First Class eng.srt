1
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:26,878
Mama!

2
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,679
Mama!

3
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:43,978
Mama!

4
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:52,004
Mother. What are you...

5
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,423
I thought you were a burglar.

6
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,925
I didn't mean to
scare you, darling.

7
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,385
I was just getting a snack.

8
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,637
Go back to bed.

9
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,473
What's the matter?

10
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,934
Go on, back to bed.

11
00:03:06,562 --> 00:03:08,479
I'll make you a hot chocolate.

12
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,439
Who are you?

13
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,988
And what have you
done with my mother?

14
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:21,325
My mother has never set
foot in this kitchen in her life.

15
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:25,204
And she certainly never
made me a hot chocolate.

16
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,124
Unless you count ordering
the maid to do it.

17
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,311
You're not scared of me?

18
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,897
I always believed I couldn't
be the only one in the world.

19
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,317
The only person who was

20
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:56,485
different.

21
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,280
And here you are.

22
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,073
Charles Xavier.

23
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:05,661
Raven.

24
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,623
You're hungry and alone.

25
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,499
Take whatever you want.

26
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:14,045
We've got lots of food.
You don't have to steal.

27
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,964
In fact,

28
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,841
you never have to steal again.

29
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,483
Understand this, Erik...

30
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,403
These Nazis, I'm not like them.

31
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:46,035
Genes are the key, yes?

32
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,288
But their goals?

33
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:53,834
Blue eyes? Blond hair? Pathetic.

34
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,088
Mmm!

35
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:00,925
Eat the chocolate.

36
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,010
It's good.

37
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:04,845
Want some?

38
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,141
I want to see my mama.

39
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:21,404
Genes are the key that unlocks
the door to a new age, Erik.

40
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:25,491
A new future for mankind.

41
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,661
Evolution.

42
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,830
You know what I'm talking about?

43
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,918
It's a simple thing I ask of you.

44
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:41,006
A little coin is nothing
compared to a big gate.

45
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:43,592
Is it?

46
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:55,062
Ja.

47
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,568
I tried, herr doctor.

48
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:04,905
I can't... I don't...

49
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,657
It's impossible.

50
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,495
The one thing I can
say for the Nazis

51
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,373
is their methods seem
to produce results.

52
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,253
I'm sorry, Erik.

53
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,474
Mama!

54
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,684
My darling.

55
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:35,686
How are you?

56
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,150
Here's what we're going to do.

57
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:44,445
I'm going to count to three...

58
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,365
And you're going to move the coin.

59
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:53,454
You don't move the coin,
I pull the trigger.

60
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,416
Understand?

61
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,878
One.

62
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:02,505
Mama.

63
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:03,756
You can do it.

64
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,054
Two.

65
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,350
Everything is all right.

66
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:31,784
Three.

67
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,015
Yes. Wonderful.

68
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,110
Excellent.

69
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,875
Nein!

70
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,281
Outstanding, Erik.

71
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:57,161
So we unlock your gift with anger.

72
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,624
Anger and pain.

73
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,878
You and me...

74
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,965
We're going to have a
lot of fun together.

75
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,416
Heterochromia.

76
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,628
A gentleman would at least
offer to buy me a drink first.

77
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,299
Norman, a pint of bitter for
me and a Brandy for the lady, please.

78
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,843
How did you know that?
Lucky guess.

79
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,012
My name is Xavier.
Charles Xavier.

80
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,304
How do you do? Amy.

81
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,306
Heterochromia was in
reference to your eyes,

82
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,892
which I have to say are stunning.

83
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,602
One green, one blue.

84
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,896
It's a mutation. It's a
very groovy mutation.

85
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,523
I've got news for you, Amy.

86
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,191
You are a mutant.

87
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,818
First you proposition a girl,

88
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,945
and then you call her deformed.

89
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,156
How is that seduction
technique working for you?

90
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,400
I'll tell you in the morning.

91
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,577
No, seriously,
though, you mustn't knock it.

92
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,454
Mutation took us from
single-celled organisms

93
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:06,957
to being the dominant form of
reproductive life on this planet.

94
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:10,169
Infinite forms of variation
with each generation,

95
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,921
all through mutation.

96
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,924
Then let's reclaim that word.

97
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,514
Mutant and proud.
Chin-chin. Hey.

98
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,099
I guess I have to buy my own drink.

99
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,309
I'm sorry. One cola.

100
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:26,852
Charles here was just telling me

101
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,354
that I'm like one of the first
sea creatures that grew legs.

102
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,398
A tiny bit sexier.

103
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:34,485
I'm sorry. This is
my sister, raven.

104
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:35,819
Hi. Amy.

105
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,447
And what do you study?
Waitressing.

106
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,740
Ah.

107
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,536
Oh, look, you have
heterochromia, too.

108
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,539
Sorry, what? Look at her eye.

109
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,961
Right. Raven, get
your coat, please.

110
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,130
Don't talk to me.
You did that on purpose.

111
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,341
I did not! Why would I do it
on purpose? Yes, you did!

112
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,760
You know I can't control it
sometimes if I'm stressed or tired.

113
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,763
You seem to be doing a
perfectly good job right now.

114
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,640
"Mutant and proud." What?

115
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,308
Or is it only with
pretty mutations,

116
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,185
or invisible ones like yours?

117
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,812
But if you're a freak,
you better hide.

118
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,064
You're being ridiculous.

119
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,233
I don't mean to sound
like an old fart.

120
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,442
Which you are.

121
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:16,652
Sometimes.

122
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,488
But we've talked about this, raven.

123
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,073
A small slip-up is one thing.

124
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,991
A big one does not
bear thinking about.

125
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:31,500
"Mutant and proud."

126
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,088
"Mutant and proud"?

127
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,350
If only.

128
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,525
Would you date me?
Of course I would.

129
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,903
Any young man would be lucky
to have you. You are stunning.

130
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,113
Looking like this?

131
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,198
Like... what?

132
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,744
Blue?

133
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,832
You're my oldest friend.

134
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,375
I'm your only friend.

135
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,877
Thank you for that.

136
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,628
Well?

137
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,964
I'm incapable of thinking
of you that way.

138
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,215
I feel responsible for you.

139
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:24,052
Anything else would
just feel wrong.

140
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,387
But what if you didn't know me?

141
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,638
Unfortunately, I do know you.

142
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,140
I don't know what's
gotten into you lately.

143
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,017
You're awfully concerned
with your looks.

144
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,481
I'm sleepy.
Will you read to me?

145
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,859
I can't. I have my thesis
coming up. I have to study.

146
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,862
Fine, read that. Your thesis
always sends me right off.

147
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:46,325
"To homo neanderthalensis, his
mutant cousin, homo sapiens,"

148
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:47,492
"was an aberration."

149
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:52,581
"Peaceful cohabitation, if ever
it existed, was short-lived."

150
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,124
"Records show,
without exception,"

151
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:57,336
"that the arrival of the mutated
human species in any region"

152
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,588
"was followed by the
immediate extinction"

153
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,382
"of their less-evolved kin."

154
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:11,600
Possession of that gold is illegal.

155
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,935
I should inform the police.

156
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,395
Let's not play this game.

157
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,439
Where did you get it?

158
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,399
A friend.

159
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,152
He recommended your
bank most highly.

160
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,113
I see.

161
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,616
Do you know our terms, sir?

162
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,201
Yes.

163
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,121
And you should know mine.

164
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,418
This gold is what
remains of my people.

165
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:40,879
Melted from their possessions.

166
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:42,965
Torn from their teeth.

167
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,967
This is blood money.

168
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,136
And you're going to help me find
the bastards responsible for it.

169
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,269
Don't touch that alarm.

170
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:01,984
I want schmidt. Klaus schmidt.

171
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,151
Where is he?

172
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,862
Our clients don't provide
addresses. We're not...

173
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:08,407
Not that sort of bank?

174
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,791
Metal fillings, eh?

175
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:18,875
Not gold.

176
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,419
Worried someone
might steal them?

177
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:23,714
Argentina! Schmidt
is in Argentina!

178
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:28,927
Villa gesell! Please!

179
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,194
Thank you.

180
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,076
I would love to kill you.

181
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,374
So mark my words.

182
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:03,962
If you warn anyone I'm coming...

183
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:05,714
I will find you.

184
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,687
Another day
at the office.

185
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:22,522
Is that
colonel hendry?

186
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:23,982
<i>The NATO guy?</i>

187
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,525
Yeah.

188
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:27,819
Yes, it is.

189
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,322
Because that's three mob
bosses, the Italian ambassador

190
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,366
and the ceo of lockheed.

191
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,326
They can't all be communists.

192
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,870
This hellfire club, it's
got to be something else.

193
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,916
Do you see that?

194
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,085
Hello, girls.

195
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,170
Wow! Very nice.

196
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,256
What are you doing?

197
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:52,094
<i>Using some equipment the CIA
didn't give me. Stay put.</i>

198
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,224
Colonel hendry? Yes, ma'am.

199
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,394
Emma frost. Sebastian
Shaw's associate.

200
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,730
And where is Mr. Shaw?

201
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:07,192
We're having a party, and
here's the entertainment.

202
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,860
Come with me.

203
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,613
Down like a roller coaster.

204
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,032
Back like a loop-the-loop.

205
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:17,202
And around like a
merry-go-round.

206
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,871
We ate and ate at
a hot dog stand.

207
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,356
We danced around to a rocking band.

208
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:26,753
And when I could, I
gave that girl a hug.

209
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,922
In the tunnel of love.

210
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,299
You'll never know how
great a kiss can feel.

211
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:34,052
When you stop at the
top of a Ferris wheel.

212
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:38,014
When I fell in love
down at palisades park.

213
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:48,984
Hello, beautiful. How are you?

214
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,778
Hey, baby. You want to
find a quiet place?

215
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:55,991
I am so sorry. I've been
booked by colonel hendry.

216
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,743
Excuse me.

217
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,245
We ate and ate at a hot dog stand.

218
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,081
We danced around
to a rocking band.

219
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:06,877
And when I could, I
gave that girl a hug.

220
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:09,296
In the tunnel of love.

221
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,381
You'll never know how
great a kiss can feel.

222
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:21,475
You sure we can't get
you a refill, Bob?

223
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,934
No.

224
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:28,023
So, I hear you blocked the proposal to
position Jupiter missiles in Turkey.

225
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:32,194
I expect you'll reconsider.

226
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,029
We've had this conversation.

227
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:38,241
You put our nukes in Turkey or
anywhere that close to Russia,

228
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,118
and you're looking at war.

229
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:41,703
Nuclear war.

230
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,321
I don't ask for favors, colonel.

231
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:19,074
I express my expectations.

232
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:22,661
So, let me say it again.

233
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:25,914
I expect you'll reconsider.

234
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,959
The only thing I will reconsider

235
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:32,254
is having another glass of
that delicious champagne.

236
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,894
What the hell did you
put in my drink?

237
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,123
You're thinking of running.
Hiding.

238
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,125
We'd find you, hendry.

239
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,044
There's not a fortress in the
world that could keep us out.

240
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,731
Magnificent. Isn't she, Bob?

241
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:37,986
Genetic mutation.
The evolution of the human genome.

242
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,529
Where's azazel?

243
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,429
Ah. We don't want the
colonel to be late.

244
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,375
Comrade.

245
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:58,089
Missiles in Turkey
send a very clear message.

246
00:20:58,174 --> 00:20:59,424
If we ever decide to fire them,

247
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,467
the Russian early-warning system

248
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,135
won't even have time to kick in.

249
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,928
This better be
important, mactaggert.

250
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:06,348
Whoa, slow down.

251
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,767
Are you smoking them funny cigarettes?
People don't disappear.

252
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,143
Colonel hendry was there.

253
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,062
He was there, mccone,
in the hellfire club.

254
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:13,647
Colonel hendry?

255
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,774
I agree with you, general.

256
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,317
I've reconsidered my position

257
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:20,779
and I now believe we should put
Jupiter missiles in Turkey.

258
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,072
Colonel hendry is here.

259
00:21:22,156 --> 00:21:25,450
So unless he magically traveled
3,000 Miles in the last 10 minutes,

260
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:29,037
listen to me, I suggest that
you stop wasting my time.

261
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,414
Looks like hendry wants
to start world war III.

262
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:34,000
I got bigger things to deal
with right now, mactaggert.

263
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:35,543
Sir, I...

264
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,796
God!
Have you lost your mind?

265
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,090
So, now what?

266
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,761
We find an expert on
genetic mutation.

267
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:50,016
PR ofessor of genetics,
Charles Francis Xavier.

268
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,771
So, how does it feel
to be a Professor?

269
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,815
Don't call me that. You don't
get to be called a Professor

270
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:58,483
until you actually have
a teaching position.

271
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,651
I know, but it suits you.

272
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,403
Don't say that. Do say,
"let's go have a drink."

273
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,738
Let's go have a drink.
Wonderful.

274
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,143
Afternoon, gentlemen.

275
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:35,478
Hot out there.

276
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,605
Beer, please.

277
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:03,339
German beer.
Of course.

278
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:07,552
Yes, it's bitburger.
You like it?

279
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:15,685
The best.

280
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:23,401
What brings you to Argentina?

281
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:28,198
The climate.
I'm a pig farmer.

282
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:35,497
Tailor.
Since I was a boy.

283
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:38,124
My father made the finest
suits in Dusseldorf.

284
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,128
My parents were from Dusseldorf.

285
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:43,338
Ah.

286
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:44,756
What was their name?

287
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,591
They didn't have a name.

288
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,428
It was taken away from them...

289
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,055
By pig farmers...

290
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,599
And tailors.

291
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,547
Blood and honor.

292
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:27,715
Which would you
care to shed first?

293
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:29,717
We were under orders...

294
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:30,885
Blood then.

295
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,597
Freeze, asshole.

296
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,224
Come on, shoot.

297
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,913
Who... what are you?

298
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:05,169
Let's just say I'm
Frankenstein's monster.

299
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:18,933
And I'm looking for my creator.

300
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:25,690
Drink! Drink! Drink!

301
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,658
Yeah!

302
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:44,125
I'm so proud of you. Thank you.

303
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,753
I need another drink. And
you need another cola.

304
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,051
Congratulations, Professor.
Thank you very much.

305
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,736
It's much harder than
it looks, actually.

306
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,054
No, on your presentation.

307
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:58,723
You were at my presentation? How
nice of you. Thank you very much.

308
00:25:58,724 --> 00:25:59,807
Moira mactaggert.

309
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:01,893
Charles Xavier. Do
you have a minute?

310
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:05,104
For a pretty little bean
with a mutated mcrl gene?

311
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:06,773
I have five.

312
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:11,653
<i>I say "MCRL," you would
say "AUBURN HAIR."</i>

313
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:13,112
It's a mutation.

314
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:14,864
It's a very groovy mutation.

315
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:17,200
Mutation, right,

316
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:21,412
took us from single-celled
organisms to the dominant form...

317
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:24,207
You know what? This routine may
go over great with the co-eds,

318
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,708
but I'm here on business.

319
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:26,876
What?

320
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:29,087
I really need your help.

321
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:30,505
All right.

322
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,092
The kind of mutations that you
were talking about in your thesis.

323
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:36,177
I need to know if they may
have already happened.

324
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:39,222
In people alive today.

325
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:53,027
Professor?

326
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,364
I think we should just
talk when you're sober.

327
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,648
Do you have any time tomorrow?

328
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,704
Something tells me you already
know the answer to your question.

329
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:09,585
This is very important to me, and if
I can help you, I will do my utmost.

330
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:10,795
Thank you.

331
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,676
Still drinking champagne, Bob?

332
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,720
I will pass.

333
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:21,723
Okay, well, so much
for the pleasantries.

334
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:25,727
I was wondering who you told
about our little arrangement.

335
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:27,145
No one.

336
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,191
- He's telling the truth.
- Good.

337
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,485
Well, I guess we're done here.

338
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,070
Let's wrap things up, shall we?

339
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,952
Oh, I knew better
than to trust you.

340
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,540
Now, you let me walk out
of here with my money,

341
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:51,753
or I will pull this
pin, and we all die.

342
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:55,173
Go ahead. Pull it.

343
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:57,133
I'll do it, I swear to God.

344
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:08,227
No, you won't.

345
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,108
But I will.

346
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,332
You're one of them?

347
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,167
Very astute of you, colonel hendry.

348
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,127
You want to guess what I can do?

349
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:36,172
I've got the power to absorb energy.
It keeps me young.

350
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,965
But that's the boring part.

351
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:41,803
The fun stuff is what I can
do with it once I've got it.

352
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,811
The advent
of the nuclear age

353
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:51,687
may have accelerated
the mutation process.

354
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:57,443
Individuals with extraordinary
abilities may already be among us.

355
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:58,569
Thank you very much.

356
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:01,239
Mactaggert, you really think
that some crackpot scientist

357
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:05,243
is going to make me believe in
sparkly dames and vanishing men?

358
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:08,412
You just bought yourself a one-way
ticket back to the typing pool.

359
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:09,956
This meeting is over.

360
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:13,459
Please sit down, agent mactaggert.

361
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:15,503
I didn't really expect
you to believe me,

362
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,755
given that all you could think
about during my presentation was

363
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,217
what sort of pie they were
serving in the commissary.

364
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,261
It's apple pecan.

365
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:25,763
I haven't been entirely honest
with you, love. I'm sorry.

366
00:29:25,848 --> 00:29:28,099
You see, one of the
many spectacular things

367
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:32,478
my mutation allows me to do
is that I can read your mind.

368
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,189
I've seen this before
in a magic show.

369
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:39,235
Are you going to ask us to think of
a number between one and 10 now?

370
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,028
No, agent stryker. Although,

371
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,156
I could ask you about
your son, William,

372
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,866
who you were thinking
about, which is very nice.

373
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,660
But I think I'd rather ask you
about the Jupiter missiles

374
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,871
America are currently
placing in Turkey.

375
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,082
He's a goddamn spy.

376
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:55,835
You brought a goddamned
spy into this facility!

377
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:17,315
How's that for a magic trick?

378
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:22,612
Best I've ever seen.

379
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,239
I want them out of here.

380
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:28,159
And locked down until I can
figure out what to do.

381
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:30,411
My facility is off-site.

382
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:33,664
I'll take them.

383
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:36,959
<i>I can't believe this. You'd
think the director of the CIA</i>

384
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:38,169
would have a little more composure.

385
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,629
We should be going
after Shaw right now.

386
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:42,131
But instead, he's out there
worrying about the wrong mutants.

387
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,758
What are we going to do, levene?

388
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,802
Levene?
Levene, what's wrong with you?

389
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:50,598
Absolutely nothing.

390
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,017
I've just frozen him for a moment
because I'd like to talk to you.

391
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,435
It's good, isn't it?

392
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,104
I'm as interested in this
Sebastian Shaw as you are.

393
00:30:57,189 --> 00:31:01,025
If you still want my help, meet me on
the third floor of the parking garage.

394
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:04,238
I've always known that
there were people like you out there.

395
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:07,865
I've been the laughing stock of this
agency for years, but I knew it!

396
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:08,908
You are going to love my facility.

397
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,993
- That's going to have to wait.
- Why?

398
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,954
Agent mactaggert has a
lead on Sebastian Shaw,

399
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:15,478
and if we don't move now, apparently,
we're going to lose him.

400
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,875
What?
Not only can he read minds,

401
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,460
he can communicate
with them as well.

402
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,462
Moira and I have just had
a lovely conversation.

403
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:22,713
Yes, we did.

404
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,049
That is incredible!

405
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:28,135
But I cannot take you anywhere else
without permission from upstairs.

406
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,221
Like to see one more
magic trick? Okay.

407
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,723
Get in the car. Good idea.

408
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:54,495
Herr doktor.

409
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,876
Little Erik lensherr.

410
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,087
He's here to kill you.

411
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,596
What kind of a greeting is that...

412
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,600
After all these years?

413
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,362
Emma.

414
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:30,614
We don't harm our own kind.

415
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:34,785
Ah! Now it's a party.

416
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:38,456
<i>This
is the us coast guard.</i>

417
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:42,543
Do not attempt to move your
vessel. Stay where you are.

418
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:50,718
They have a telepath.

419
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:57,391
I've lost Shaw.
I've lost Shaw.

420
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:59,310
There's something blocking me.

421
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,478
This has never
happened to me before.

422
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:02,813
I think there's someone
like me on that ship.

423
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,441
Like you?
I'm sorry, a telepath.

424
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:06,525
This is incredible.

425
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,444
I could actually feel her
inside my mind. I'm very sorry,

426
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,779
but I don't think I'm gonna
be much help tonight.

427
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:10,905
You're on your own.

428
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:26,337
Oh, my God! Jesus!

429
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,634
Get inside.

430
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:38,474
Stop, stop, stop.

431
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:42,311
Charles!
Are you okay?

432
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:43,636
There's someone else out there.

433
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:48,651
There.

434
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:53,197
Time to go.

435
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,503
Let go!

436
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,798
You have to let it go!

437
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:54,800
You've got to put someone
in the water to help him.

438
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:58,012
Let it go!
You have to let it go!

439
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:21,785
You can't. You'll drown.
You have to let go.

440
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,955
I know what this means to
you, but you're going to die.

441
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,168
Please, Erik, calm your mind.

442
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:42,306
Get off me!
Get off!

443
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,642
Calm down! Just breathe.
We're here!

444
00:35:44,726 --> 00:35:46,852
Who are you?
My name is Charles Xavier.

445
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,897
You were in my head.
How did you do that?

446
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:51,982
You have your tricks,
I have mine.

447
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,235
I'm like you.
Just calm your mind.

448
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:57,905
I thought I was alone.

449
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:00,741
You're not alone.

450
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,912
Erik, you're not alone.

451
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,185
Welcome to my facility.

452
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,937
My mission has been to investigate

453
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:33,107
the application of paranormal
powers in military defense.

454
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,109
Or offense.

455
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,403
This guy Shaw, schmidt,

456
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:38,687
whatever you want to call him,

457
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,197
he's working with the Russians.

458
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:42,616
We might need your help to stop him.
Marvelous.

459
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:45,661
<i>So we're to be the CIA's
new mutant division, yes?</i>

460
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:47,955
Something like that.

461
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:55,629
It's a supersonic.
The most advanced plane ever built.

462
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:00,175
You should see it in real life.
It's incredible.

463
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:04,179
Hank, these are the special new
recruits I was telling you about.

464
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:07,224
This is Hank McCoy, one of our
most talented young researchers.

465
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:10,978
How wonderful. Another
mutant, already here.

466
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,105
Why didn't you say?

467
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,315
Say what?

468
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,735
Because you don't know.

469
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:21,071
I am so, so terribly sorry.

470
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:24,908
Hank?

471
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:27,369
You didn't ask,
so I didn't tell.

472
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:29,079
So, your
mutation is what?

473
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:30,414
You're super-smart?

474
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,832
I'll say.

475
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,834
Hank here graduated
Harvard at the age of 15.

476
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:37,171
I wish that's all it was.

477
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:39,089
You're among friends now, Hank.

478
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:40,633
You can show off.

479
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:57,900
Splendid.

480
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:06,200
I'm sorry.

481
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,540
Ta-da!

482
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:21,632
You're amazing.

483
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:23,550
Really?

484
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:30,641
<i>"The presence
of us missiles in Turkey"</i>

485
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,393
<i>"represents an
unprecedented threat"</i>

486
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:34,269
<i>"to the people of
the Soviet union,"</i>

487
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:37,731
warned Russian foreign minister
gromyko earlier today.

488
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:41,318
But he was quick to insist the
Russians would not be the first

489
00:38:41,403 --> 00:38:43,612
to initiate any military action.

490
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:46,490
Yeah, we'll fix that as
soon as we get to Russia.

491
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:49,159
<i>Unless the CIA find us first.</i>

492
00:38:49,244 --> 00:38:51,412
I'll take care of them, too.

493
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,915
If that telepath gets
inside your head,

494
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,334
he won't be as much fun as I am.

495
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:59,294
Already in hand, my love.

496
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,931
The Russians

497
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,185
made me this.

498
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:20,441
So, what am I thinking?

499
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,285
I don't know.

500
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,206
I was thinking that you are
the most exquisite thing

501
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,833
I have ever seen in my life.

502
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,006
And that this needs ice.

503
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,259
Fetch me some.

504
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,635
There's a good girl.

505
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:18,165
I promised myself I'd find a cure
ever since I was a little boy.

506
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:22,628
You have no idea what
I'd give to feel

507
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:24,338
normal. Normal.

508
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:31,512
Charles has never understood.

509
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:34,431
He's different, but
he's never had to hide.

510
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:37,184
Hank, this serum
that you're making,

511
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,770
it doesn't affect
abilities, right?

512
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,773
Just appearance.
It normalizes it.

513
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:43,982
Yeah.

514
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,443
Do you think it would work on me?

515
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,571
I can look into it, if you'd like.

516
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:50,989
It's the least I can do

517
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:53,474
after asking you to come down
here with such a weird request.

518
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,287
I have to admit, usually when guys ask
me out, they're not after my blood.

519
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:01,917
Sorry. I didn't intend
to be forward. I was just...

520
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:06,213
I was excited. You know, the
nature of your mutation.

521
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,383
If any genes hold the key to
changing appearance, it's yours.

522
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,802
Hank, you weren't being forward.

523
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,762
That's kind of what I meant.

524
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:15,848
No.

525
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:18,016
But I'm just sorry if
you thought I was.

526
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:20,394
And I'm sorry that you weren't.

527
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:24,064
Go ahead.
Take the blood.

528
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,369
Sorry.
Did I hurt you?

529
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,623
Kinky.

530
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:47,462
By the way, if I looked like you,

531
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:49,131
I wouldn't change a thing.

532
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:17,491
From what
I know about you,

533
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,912
I'm surprised you've
managed to stay this long.

534
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:22,915
What do you know about me?

535
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,125
Everything.

536
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:26,919
Then you know to
stay out of my head.

537
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:31,006
I'm sorry, Erik, but I've
seen what Shaw did to you.

538
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:35,135
I've felt your agony.

539
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,639
I can help you.

540
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:46,813
I don't need your help.

541
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:49,066
Don't kid yourself. You
needed my help last night.

542
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,652
It's not just me you're
walking away from.

543
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:56,573
Here you have the chance to be part of
something much bigger than yourself.

544
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,787
I won't stop you leaving.
I could.

545
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,625
But I won't.

546
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,672
Shaw has got friends.

547
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:14,841
You could do with some.

548
00:43:20,682 --> 00:43:23,642
<i>Hank turned that radar
installation into a transmitter.</i>

549
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:26,269
It's designed to amplify brainwaves

550
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:28,689
so it could enhance
your telepathic powers,

551
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:30,899
help us find other mutants
for our division.

552
00:43:30,984 --> 00:43:33,026
What if they don't want
to be found by you?

553
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:34,653
Erik.

554
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,154
You decided to stay.

555
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,368
If a new species is
being discovered,

556
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,286
it should be by it's own kind.

557
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:45,872
Charles and I find the mutants.
No suits.

558
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:47,791
First of all, that's
my machine out there.

559
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,794
Second of all, and much more
importantly, this is Charles' decision.

560
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,713
<i>Charles is fine with the
CIA being involved.</i>

561
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:54,339
Isn't that right?

562
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,094
No. I'm sorry, but
I'm with Erik.

563
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:02,305
We'll find them alone.

564
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:04,850
What if I say no?

565
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:09,271
Then good luck using your
installation without me.

566
00:44:21,451 --> 00:44:23,952
I call it cerebro.

567
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:28,040
As in the Spanish for "brain." Yes.

568
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:31,501
Okay, so, the electrodes connect Charles
to the transmitter on the roof.

569
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:35,672
When he picks up a mutant, his brain
sends a signal through a relay

570
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:38,842
and then the co-ordinates of their
location are printed out here.

571
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,135
You designed this?

572
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,303
Yeah.

573
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:46,475
What an adorable lab
rat you make, Charles.

574
00:44:46,476 --> 00:44:48,560
Don't spoil this for me, Erik.

575
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:51,104
I've been a lab rat. I
know one when I see one.

576
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:55,233
Okay, great. Are you sure
we can't shave your head?

577
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:57,444
Don't touch my hair. Okay.

578
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:42,197
It's working!

579
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:03,635
For that, daddy-o, you
get a private dance.

580
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,099
You cats know it's
double for both, right?

581
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,350
Mmm.

582
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,435
No, that won't be necessary.
Although, I'm sure it'd be magical.

583
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,939
We were thinking more,
we'll show you ours

584
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,357
if you show us yours.

585
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,818
Baby, that is not the way
it works around here.

586
00:46:21,863 --> 00:46:23,238
More tea, vicar?

587
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,699
Don't mind if I do.

588
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,786
My turn.

589
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:49,973
How would you like a job where
you get to keep your clothes on?

590
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:57,814
Where to, fellas? Richmond,
Virginia, please.

591
00:46:57,899 --> 00:47:00,817
Right, so, you want the airport?
The station? What?

592
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:04,070
No, we were rather hoping you
would take us all the way.

593
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:05,655
That's a six-hour drive.

594
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:08,116
That will give us
plenty of time to talk.

595
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,720
What does the government
want with a guy like Alex summers?

596
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,791
I hope you're not planning
on putting him with others.

597
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:21,671
First guy I've ever met who actually
prefers solitary confinement.

598
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:32,432
Crazy, huh?

599
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:33,683
What?

600
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:35,769
You like fish. I like fish, too.

601
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:39,689
Maybe we should get a bite
sometime, talk about it?

602
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:43,443
I'd rather go out with the fish.

603
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:51,534
These fish?

604
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:12,555
Excuse me, I'm Erik lensherr.
Charles Xavier.

605
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,599
Go fuck yourself.

606
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,454
There's nothing on radar?
Nothing.

607
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:38,498
Sonar?
Nyet.

608
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:41,501
Then we have a problem.

609
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:02,689
Beautiful, isn't it?

610
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,899
The reason we exist.

611
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:07,110
We are the children
of the atom, my love.

612
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:08,611
We have a situation.

613
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:10,905
The telepath.

614
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:13,199
I shouldn't be able to
feel him at this distance.

615
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,660
It's like his reach is

616
00:49:15,745 --> 00:49:16,870
amplified.

617
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,292
They're recruiting.

618
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:26,046
You go on to Russia.
I'll handle them.

619
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:29,996
I can't stop thinking
about the others out there.

620
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:33,887
All those minds that I touched.
I could feel them.

621
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:39,309
Their isolation, their
hopes, their ambitions.

622
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,853
I tell you, we are at the start
of something incredible, Erik.

623
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:43,063
We can help them.

624
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:44,814
Can we?

625
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:49,277
Identification,
that's how it starts.

626
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:54,115
And ends with being rounded up,
experimented on, eliminated.

627
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,992
Not this time.

628
00:49:56,077 --> 00:49:58,328
We have common enemies.
Shaw, the Russians.

629
00:49:58,412 --> 00:49:59,954
They need us.

630
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:01,498
For now.

631
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,569
We should
think of code names.

632
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:11,196
We're government agents now, we
should have secret code names.

633
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:12,460
I want to be called mystique.

634
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:15,345
Damn! I wanted to
be called mystique.

635
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,347
Well, tough. I called it.

636
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:21,643
And I'm way more
mysterious than you.

637
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:25,438
Darwin, what about you?

638
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:27,732
Well, "Darwin" is
already a nickname,

639
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:30,360
and, you know, it sort of fits.

640
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:31,820
Adapt to survive and all.

641
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,489
Check this out.

642
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,331
Whoa!

643
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:49,254
That was incredible. Thank you.

644
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:51,005
What about you?

645
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:53,758
I'm going to be.

646
00:50:53,843 --> 00:50:54,884
Banshee.

647
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:56,761
Why do you want to be named
after a wailing spirit?

648
00:50:56,846 --> 00:50:58,207
You might want to cover your ears.

649
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:15,822
Your turn.

650
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,824
My stage name is angel.

651
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,286
It kind of fits. You can fly?

652
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,163
Uh-huh. And...

653
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:33,339
What's your name?

654
00:51:34,675 --> 00:51:35,800
How about big foot?

655
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,262
You know what they say
about guys with big feet.

656
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,306
And yours are kind of small.

657
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:42,682
Okay, now.

658
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,935
Alex, what is your gift?
What can you do?

659
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,771
It's not...

660
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:51,065
I just can't do it. I
can't do it in here.

661
00:51:51,192 --> 00:51:53,443
Why
don't you just do it out there?

662
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:57,155
Alex!
Alex! Alex!

663
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:03,536
That's the spirit!

664
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:05,705
Get down when I tell you.

665
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,624
<i>"Get down
when I tell you."</i>

666
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:13,630
Get back.

667
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:20,220
Get back!

668
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:23,514
Whatever.

669
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:41,282
We have intel that Shaw is meeting with
the Russian defense chief in moscow.

670
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:43,493
So go ahead. Say it.

671
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:45,995
I'm not here to say "I told you
so." You know why I'm here.

672
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,748
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Clearance
to bring along your mutants.

673
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:52,293
Fight fire with fire.
It makes sense.

674
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:54,254
Wait! You're okay with this?

675
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:57,131
Sending in a bunch of
untrained, unauthorized freaks?

676
00:52:57,216 --> 00:53:01,678
These freaks are dedicated,
hardworking people.

677
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:04,264
Plane leaves for Russia in an hour.

678
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:06,349
I'm telling you, these kids
are not ready for Shaw.

679
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:07,392
I think they're gonna surprise you.

680
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:08,726
They're an exceptional
bunch of young people.

681
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:09,852
What the hell?

682
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:20,863
Come on! You can
go harder than that.

683
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,618
Harder!

684
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,290
What are you doing?

685
00:53:36,297 --> 00:53:37,839
Who destroyed the statue?

686
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,424
It was Alex.

687
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:40,800
No, havok.

688
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,969
We have to call him havok.
That's his name now.

689
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:46,806
And we were thinking, you
should be Professor x

690
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:49,058
and you should be Magneto.

691
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:51,602
Exceptional.

692
00:53:56,317 --> 00:53:57,859
I expect more from you.

693
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:20,381
We got a problem. What?

694
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:22,550
I'm so sorry. This
wasn't on the map.

695
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:30,475
No matter what
happens, act normally.

696
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,393
I'll take care of this, all right?

697
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:34,729
Now, listen to me...

698
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,318
- Where are you going?
- To our farm.

699
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:43,946
Open the back.

700
00:54:44,031 --> 00:54:45,948
As you wish.

701
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:52,121
Easy, easy.
Take it easy, chaps.

702
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:10,598
- Anything back there?
- Nothing. It's empty.

703
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:15,561
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

704
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:41,337
- Where is Shaw?
- I don't know.

705
00:55:41,422 --> 00:55:44,757
But if she's a telepath and I
read her, she'll know we're here.

706
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:48,094
Let me try something else.

707
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:07,780
Shaw sends his apologies
but he's indisposed.

708
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:10,491
He asked me to come in his place.

709
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:14,787
And between you and I, honey,
I'm a lot better company.

710
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:15,997
Please, come in.

711
00:56:21,462 --> 00:56:22,462
He's not coming.

712
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:27,216
So, what now, boss?

713
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:29,802
Now, nothing. We're here
for Shaw. Mission aborted.

714
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:31,637
The hell it is. Erik.

715
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:34,390
She's his right-hand woman.
That's good enough for me.

716
00:56:34,683 --> 00:56:38,144
<i>The CIA invading the home of a senior
Soviet official. Are you crazy?</i>

717
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,313
<i>I'm not CIA.</i>

718
00:56:40,606 --> 00:56:41,606
Erik!

719
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:46,319
Your health.

720
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,575
So, you must be busy
planning your next move.

721
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:55,870
What with the Americans refusing to
remove their missiles from Turkey.

722
00:56:57,331 --> 00:57:00,500
You know I can't talk about
those things, miss frost.

723
00:57:01,126 --> 00:57:02,585
Emma.

724
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:07,507
And don't worry.

725
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:10,176
You don't have to say a word.

726
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:27,401
He's gonna start
world war III single-handed.

727
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:30,071
We have to do something.
Like what?

728
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,489
We're moving out.
You can't!

729
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:49,590
I'm sorry.
I can't leave him.

730
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,521
For God's sake, Erik!
Be calm.

731
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,232
Be calm.

732
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:08,484
Forget my face.

733
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:22,039
You are beautiful, so beautiful!
Yes!

734
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:24,292
Pathetic.

735
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:33,759
Yes!

736
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:36,929
Nice trick.

737
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:40,725
Who are you?

738
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:45,771
Go to sleep.

739
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:56,198
You can stop trying to
read my mind, sugar.

740
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:01,120
You're never going to get anything
from me while I'm like this.

741
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,499
So, then, you can just tell us.

742
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:19,972
Where is Shaw?

743
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:27,438
Erik.

744
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:35,154
Erik, that's enough.

745
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:44,872
Erik, that's enough!

746
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:56,092
All yours.

747
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:00,596
She won't be shifting
into diamond form again.

748
01:00:00,681 --> 01:00:03,057
And if she does, just
give her a gentle tap.

749
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:32,378
We are the
children of the atom.

750
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:35,381
Radiation gave birth to mutants.

751
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:39,844
What will kill the humans
will only make us stronger.

752
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:45,266
Beautiful, isn't it?

753
01:00:48,687 --> 01:00:51,230
This is worse than we
previously imagined.

754
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:55,359
We're taking you with us.

755
01:00:55,444 --> 01:00:57,528
<i>CIA will want to
question you themselves.</i>

756
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,321
Oh, I doubt it.

757
01:00:59,406 --> 01:01:02,491
They have bigger things
to worry about right now.

758
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:10,332
- Whoa!
- All right, all right.

759
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:12,376
Jesus, man, you are killing me.

760
01:01:12,461 --> 01:01:15,588
Don't beat yourself up. I've
had a lot of spare time.

761
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:22,219
Oh, I didn't know the
circus was in town.

762
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:25,237
Hey, come on, honey. Give us a little...

763
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:28,017
No?
Come on, let's see the foot.

764
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,727
There it is. Come on,
big foot, let's go.

765
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:32,146
Hey. Hey, come on. Hey.

766
01:01:36,485 --> 01:01:38,527
They're just guys being stupid.

767
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:40,237
Guys being stupid, I can handle.

768
01:01:40,322 --> 01:01:41,906
Okay?
I've handled that my whole life.

769
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:44,408
But I'd rather a bunch of guys
stare at me with my clothes off

770
01:01:44,493 --> 01:01:45,893
than the way these
ones stare at me.

771
01:01:47,788 --> 01:01:48,788
At us.

772
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:58,130
What was that?

773
01:02:00,592 --> 01:02:02,885
I don't know.
Something doesn't feel right.

774
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:13,103
No news of Shaw?

775
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:16,482
Not a peep. Not even
through that back channel?

776
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:30,037
What is that?

777
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:49,034
We have an intruder
in the main atrium.

778
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:50,307
Where are the mutants?

779
01:02:50,392 --> 01:02:52,142
If you take another step,
I'm gonna put you down.

780
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:55,521
Of course you will. But where do
I find the more evolved people?

781
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:57,690
Send back-up now!

782
01:03:00,861 --> 01:03:03,779
Get back! Do not leave that
room. We're under attack!

783
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:06,031
Shoot! Shoot!

784
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:20,754
Where are the mutants?

785
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:23,299
Put that man down
or we will open fire!

786
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:50,951
Stay here, my ass! Let's go!

787
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:59,209
Get back! We can help!
We can help!

788
01:04:58,937 --> 01:04:59,937
Wait!

789
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:01,814
You want the mutants? They're
right through that door.

790
01:05:01,982 --> 01:05:04,274
Just let us normal people go.
We're no threat...

791
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:16,829
- Where is the telepath?
- Not here.

792
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:18,664
Too bad.

793
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:20,714
Well, at least I can take
this silly thing off.

794
01:05:23,003 --> 01:05:26,839
Good evening.
My name is Sebastian Shaw.

795
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:30,217
And I am not here to hurt you.

796
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:31,802
Freeze!

797
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:33,762
Azazel.

798
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:40,644
My friends, there is
a revolution coming.

799
01:05:40,729 --> 01:05:44,106
When mankind discovers who
we are, what we can do,

800
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:45,941
each of us will face a choice.

801
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,193
Be enslaved

802
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:51,238
or rise up to rule.

803
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:54,450
Choose freely, but know that
if you are not with us,

804
01:05:54,534 --> 01:05:56,285
then, by definition, you are

805
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:58,203
against us.

806
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,206
So, you can stay

807
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:04,793
and fight for the people
who hate and fear you,

808
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:17,556
and queens.

809
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:30,819
Angel. Are you kidding me?

810
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:33,489
Come on.

811
01:06:33,573 --> 01:06:35,407
We don't belong here.

812
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,910
And that's nothing
to be ashamed of.

813
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:44,875
We have to do something.

814
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:02,976
Stop.
I'm coming with you.

815
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,607
Good choice.

816
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:11,652
So, tell me about your mutation.

817
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:14,113
Well, I adapt to survive.

818
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:19,243
So, I guess I'm coming with you.

819
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:21,453
I like that.

820
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:29,128
Alex! Get out!

821
01:07:29,254 --> 01:07:30,629
Do it!

822
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:37,553
Protecting your fellow mutants?

823
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:39,888
That's a noble gesture.

824
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:42,057
Feels good.

825
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:49,481
Adapt to this.

826
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:35,402
Hello.

827
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:43,619
<i>Once again, my sympathies for your
treatment at the hands of the CIA.</i>

828
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:46,872
These Americans are ruthless.

829
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:52,544
Now they have their missiles
placed in Turkey...

830
01:08:53,588 --> 01:08:57,841
I expect you'll be planning new
missile sites of your own.

831
01:08:58,176 --> 01:09:04,556
Somewhere you know the American
early-warning system won't help.

832
01:09:05,183 --> 01:09:09,186
I hear Cuba is lovely
this time of year.

833
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:12,397
And so close to Florida.

834
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:15,734
Missiles in Cuba?

835
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:19,696
You're serious?

836
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:23,283
We may as well declare war.

837
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:26,411
Maybe I wasn't clear enough.

838
01:09:28,957 --> 01:09:31,291
You will make this happen.

839
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:34,419
Okay.

840
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:37,506
Let's see
what kgb think about this.

841
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:45,597
Hello?
General armivolkoff.

842
01:09:48,476 --> 01:09:51,270
It's nothing.

843
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:07,828
Raven?

844
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:15,711
We've made arrangements for you
to be taken home immediately.

845
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:17,296
We're not going home.
What?

846
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:19,715
He's not going back to prison.

847
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:20,924
He killed Darwin.

848
01:10:21,009 --> 01:10:22,449
All the more reason
for you to leave.

849
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:24,261
This is over.

850
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:26,388
Darwin's dead, Charles.

851
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:28,307
And we can't even bury him.

852
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:32,227
We can avenge him.

853
01:10:35,773 --> 01:10:37,774
Erik, a word, please.

854
01:10:41,154 --> 01:10:42,195
They're just kids.

855
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:44,406
No. They were kids.

856
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:46,825
Shaw has his army, we need ours.

857
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:53,999
We'll have to train.

858
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:56,710
All of us.

859
01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:58,420
Yes? Yeah.

860
01:10:59,297 --> 01:11:01,089
Well, we can't stay here.

861
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:04,509
Even if they reopen the
department, it's not safe.

862
01:11:04,594 --> 01:11:06,678
We've got nowhere to go.

863
01:11:09,349 --> 01:11:10,432
Yes, we do.

864
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:13,393
The law says we've
got to turn her over.

865
01:11:13,478 --> 01:11:15,604
The law applies
to human beings.

866
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:19,107
The same laws don't apply to
mutants. They're too dangerous.

867
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:23,362
In times like this, security is
more important than liberty.

868
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:24,821
There is a war coming, John.

869
01:11:24,906 --> 01:11:26,073
Yes,

870
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:28,283
but a war with who?

871
01:11:42,382 --> 01:11:44,466
Excellent question.

872
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:47,302
Though I wouldn't call
it a war, exactly.

873
01:11:47,387 --> 01:11:50,764
That suggests both sides stand
an equal chance of winning.

874
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:02,818
Captain, no sign of
any American ships.

875
01:12:03,111 --> 01:12:05,654
Maintain course, full ahead.

876
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:09,157
The Russians have
sent their warheads to Cuba.

877
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:11,368
We have a week before the
ship hits the coast.

878
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:15,580
Our fleet can be on this line when
the Russian missile ship arrives.

879
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:19,167
If that ship crosses the line,

880
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:22,337
they will have declared war
against the United States.

881
01:12:22,422 --> 01:12:25,966
And we will have no choice but to
retaliate with a full nuclear response.

882
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:27,092
Do we agree?

883
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:35,267
Dispatch the 7th fleet.

884
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:38,854
This is yours?

885
01:12:38,938 --> 01:12:41,148
No, it's ours.

886
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:52,075
Honestly, Charles. I don't know how you
survived, living in such hardship.

887
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:55,745
Well, it was a hardship
softened by me.

888
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:00,292
Come on. Time for the tour.

889
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:15,182
Dear comrades...

890
01:13:15,308 --> 01:13:21,980
The United States have
dispatched warships for Cuba.

891
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:26,985
This leaves us with no choice.

892
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:31,823
Comrade first secretary...

893
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:35,327
We must send in our fleet.

894
01:13:38,498 --> 01:13:39,998
Dispatch the fleet!

895
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:48,924
President Kennedy
has signed a formal proclamation

896
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:52,552
setting up a blockade of all
missiles bound for Cuba.

897
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:55,889
The Soviet
union reacted by terming it.

898
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:59,851
"A step along the road to
unleashing a thermo-nuclear war."

899
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:11,738
You're sure?

900
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:13,990
I'm sure.

901
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:15,617
All right.

902
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:24,209
No. No, I can't. I'm sorry.

903
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:26,461
I can't shoot anybody point
blank, let alone my friend.

904
01:14:26,546 --> 01:14:28,547
Oh, come on. You know
I can deflect it.

905
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:29,965
You're always telling me
I should push myself.

906
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:31,424
If you know you can deflect it,

907
01:14:31,509 --> 01:14:35,262
then you're not
challenging yourself.

908
01:14:35,346 --> 01:14:38,640
Whatever happened to the man who
was trying to raise a submarine?

909
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:41,434
I can't. Something that big?

910
01:14:41,519 --> 01:14:43,144
I need the situation, the anger...

911
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:44,854
No, the anger is not enough.

912
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:47,274
It's gotten the job
done all this time.

913
01:14:47,567 --> 01:14:49,442
It's nearly gotten you
killed all this time.

914
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:52,571
Come here.

915
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:54,573
Let's try something a
little more challenging.

916
01:14:56,284 --> 01:15:00,579
My stepfather took the possibility of
nuclear war quite seriously. This way.

917
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:02,789
That is why he had this
bunker built down here.

918
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:05,333
I thought we could use it as
a practice range of sorts.

919
01:15:05,418 --> 01:15:07,335
You don't think I'm going
to blow through the walls?

920
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:09,629
He had this place built
to withstand a nuclear bomb.

921
01:15:09,714 --> 01:15:11,089
I think it can handle you, Alex.

922
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:14,426
You know, when I do this,
bad things tend to happen.

923
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:18,597
That's because you can't
control it. It controls you.

924
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:21,099
That's why we're here, Alex.
It's why we're training.

925
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:27,552
What you're doing is incredible.

926
01:15:27,607 --> 01:15:28,857
You're hitting a pitch
with sound waves

927
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:31,568
that have the same resonant frequency
as the glass. That's why it shatters.

928
01:15:31,652 --> 01:15:34,154
But this, it's like any
other muscle in the body.

929
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:36,197
You can control it.

930
01:15:37,658 --> 01:15:40,368
"In each of us, two
natures are at war."

931
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:42,203
Robert Louis Stevenson,
Jekyll and Hyde.

932
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:43,330
Top marks.

933
01:15:43,414 --> 01:15:45,373
The story wasn't really about
good and evil though, was it?

934
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:47,250
It was about man's animal nature

935
01:15:47,335 --> 01:15:49,336
and his struggle to
control it, to conform.

936
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,963
And it's that struggle
which is holding you back.

937
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:55,300
No, Jekyll was afraid of
what he could be capable of.

938
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:57,135
And you are, too.

939
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:59,512
If you're serious about me doing
this, you might want to get back.

940
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,014
All right.

941
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:03,099
Shall I shut the door? Yeah.

942
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:08,480
Whenever you're ready.

943
01:16:14,945 --> 01:16:15,987
Oh, my God!

944
01:16:19,617 --> 01:16:21,910
I will teach you to
control this, Alex.

945
01:16:25,373 --> 01:16:27,457
And you're sure that
this will work?

946
01:16:27,541 --> 01:16:29,334
Anything is possible.
I based the design...

947
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:31,753
Hank, stop talking. Come on.

948
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:33,922
Now, remember. Scream
as hard as you can.

949
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:35,882
You need the sound waves
to be supersonic.

950
01:16:36,008 --> 01:16:38,209
Catch them at the right angle
and they should carry you.

951
01:16:38,344 --> 01:16:40,470
They should carry me.

952
01:16:40,554 --> 01:16:43,139
That's reassuring. Good luck.

953
01:16:44,141 --> 01:16:45,975
And don't forget to scream.

954
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:56,945
Now, if you want to
beat me this time,

955
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:59,364
you have to set the beast free.

956
01:17:00,241 --> 01:17:01,700
On your marks,

957
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,284
get set,

958
01:17:03,703 --> 01:17:05,036
go!

959
01:17:19,427 --> 01:17:21,469
Congratulations, my friend.

960
01:17:21,554 --> 01:17:23,314
<i>Robert Louis Stevenson
would have been proud.</i>

961
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:26,766
Impressive, Hank.

962
01:17:26,851 --> 01:17:28,771
With feet like those, all
you need is a red nose.

963
01:17:28,978 --> 01:17:30,603
Right, bozo?

964
01:17:30,688 --> 01:17:32,731
I'm done here. Thank you, Alex.

965
01:17:33,983 --> 01:17:35,191
Come on, Hank.

966
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:48,663
If you're using half your
concentration to look normal,

967
01:17:49,248 --> 01:17:52,375
then you're only half paying attention
to whatever else you're doing.

968
01:17:52,752 --> 01:17:56,087
Just pointing out something
that could save your life.

969
01:17:59,592 --> 01:18:01,259
You want society to accept you,

970
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:05,013
but you can't even accept yourself.

971
01:18:10,644 --> 01:18:12,437
Sexy!

972
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:13,980
Well, this is just the prototype.

973
01:18:14,064 --> 01:18:15,523
The real one will look
considerably better.

974
01:18:15,608 --> 01:18:18,568
It will be a whole suit. See, these
sensors measure your energy output.

975
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:21,362
This panel focuses it and
the excess is absorbed.

976
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:22,864
Try hitting the one in the middle.

977
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:24,269
Just the one in the middle, mind.

978
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:26,117
Good luck.

979
01:18:36,253 --> 01:18:39,088
You got to see this. Your genes
are extraordinary, you know that?

980
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:40,840
Your cells age at half the
rate of a normal human.

981
01:18:40,925 --> 01:18:43,718
When you're 40, you'll still have
the leucocytes of a teenager.

982
01:18:43,803 --> 01:18:48,223
You have the most incredible
cellular structure I've ever seen.

983
01:18:52,603 --> 01:18:54,437
And you truly
believe I'll fly this time?

984
01:18:54,522 --> 01:18:55,855
Unreservedly.

985
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:57,607
I trust you. I'm touched.

986
01:18:57,691 --> 01:18:59,484
I don't trust him.
Say nothing.

987
01:19:00,694 --> 01:19:02,237
I'm gonna die!

988
01:19:02,321 --> 01:19:04,239
Look, we're not going to make you
do anything you don't feel...

989
01:19:04,323 --> 01:19:05,573
Here, let me help.

990
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:08,451
Erik!

991
01:19:29,682 --> 01:19:31,182
What?

992
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:32,934
You know you were
thinking the same.

993
01:19:33,686 --> 01:19:35,103
Wonderful work, Hank.
Thank you very much.

994
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:36,980
All right, Alex, I want
you to hit the "X".

995
01:19:37,857 --> 01:19:39,537
And try not to hit me.
There's a good chap.

996
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:43,027
You're serious?
I'm very serious.

997
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:45,363
I have complete and
utter faith in you.

998
01:19:58,669 --> 01:19:59,711
Am I still a bozo?

999
01:20:00,379 --> 01:20:03,172
Yes, Hank, you're still a bozo.

1000
01:20:03,424 --> 01:20:04,424
But nice job.

1001
01:20:07,678 --> 01:20:08,803
See that?

1002
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:11,639
Try turning it to face us.

1003
01:20:30,534 --> 01:20:35,663
You know, I believe that true focus lies
somewhere between rage and serenity.

1004
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:39,334
Would you mind if I...

1005
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:15,411
What did you just do to me?

1006
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:20,583
I accessed the brightest
corner of your memory system.

1007
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:25,546
It's a very beautiful
memory, Erik. Thank you.

1008
01:21:25,631 --> 01:21:28,257
I didn't know I still had that.

1009
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:31,552
There is so much more
to you than you know.

1010
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:34,639
Not just pain and anger.

1011
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:36,307
There is good, too.
I felt it.

1012
01:21:37,643 --> 01:21:39,560
When you can access all of that,

1013
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:42,814
you'll possess a power
no one can match.

1014
01:21:43,982 --> 01:21:45,400
Not even me.

1015
01:21:47,069 --> 01:21:49,654
So, come on. Try again.

1016
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:31,738
Hey! Well done.

1017
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:33,865
The president is about
to make his address.

1018
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:39,954
It shall be the policy of
this nation to regard any nuclear missile

1019
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:43,666
crossing the embargo
line that surrounds Cuba

1020
01:22:43,751 --> 01:22:47,962
as an attack by the Soviet
union on the United States

1021
01:22:48,046 --> 01:22:51,716
requiring a full retaliatory
response upon the Soviet union...

1022
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:52,967
That's where we're
going to find Shaw.

1023
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:54,177
How do you know?

1024
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:57,972
Two superpowers facing off and
he wants to start world war III.

1025
01:22:58,056 --> 01:22:59,724
He won't leave anything to chance.

1026
01:22:59,892 --> 01:23:01,726
So much for diplomacy.

1027
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:04,187
I suggest you all get
a good night's sleep.

1028
01:23:04,271 --> 01:23:06,314
Ultimately
leads to war.

1029
01:23:07,274 --> 01:23:11,652
Tensions mount as the
Soviet missile ship nears Cuba.

1030
01:23:11,737 --> 01:23:16,532
All diplomatic efforts to avert
nuclear war have thus far failed.

1031
01:23:16,617 --> 01:23:18,493
As the American people
ready themselves

1032
01:23:18,577 --> 01:23:20,995
for the likelihood
of an atomic attack,

1033
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:24,499
there are widespread
reports of panic-buying,

1034
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:28,920
supermarkets cleared, as shelters
unused since the second world war

1035
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:31,506
are stocked for what may lie ahead.

1036
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:36,177
In all it's history, America has
never faced a greater threat.

1037
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:38,054
The world is primed for war

1038
01:23:38,222 --> 01:23:40,640
and there's no one to stop me.

1039
01:23:45,646 --> 01:23:46,687
Come in.

1040
01:23:47,815 --> 01:23:49,232
Hey.

1041
01:23:49,942 --> 01:23:51,943
I have a surprise for you.

1042
01:24:00,410 --> 01:24:03,996
I isolated the right
marker in your DNA sample.

1043
01:24:04,081 --> 01:24:05,873
The serum works like an antibiotic,

1044
01:24:05,958 --> 01:24:09,126
attacking the cells that
'cause our physical mutation.

1045
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:11,963
It won't affect our abilities,
just our appearance.

1046
01:24:14,633 --> 01:24:16,259
Do you still want to do this?

1047
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:19,804
Should we have to hide?

1048
01:24:21,181 --> 01:24:23,057
Well, you already do.

1049
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:26,060
You're hiding right now,
like I have my whole life.

1050
01:24:26,854 --> 01:24:30,147
I don't want to feel like a freak all
the time. I just want to look...

1051
01:24:30,232 --> 01:24:32,316
Normal. Yeah.

1052
01:24:39,616 --> 01:24:40,658
Hank, don't!

1053
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:44,996
You're beautiful, Hank.

1054
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,331
Everything you are,
you are perfect.

1055
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:53,254
Look at all of us. Look at all
we've achieved this week.

1056
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:55,339
All we will achieve.

1057
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:58,968
We are different.

1058
01:24:59,052 --> 01:25:01,470
But we shouldn't be trying
to fit into society.

1059
01:25:02,556 --> 01:25:05,725
Society should aspire
to be more like us.

1060
01:25:06,727 --> 01:25:09,770
Mutant and proud.

1061
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:16,569
It behooves me to tell you

1062
01:25:16,653 --> 01:25:18,738
that even if we save
the world tomorrow,

1063
01:25:18,822 --> 01:25:21,949
and mutants are
accepted into society,

1064
01:25:22,034 --> 01:25:25,453
my feet and your natural blue form

1065
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:27,455
will never be deemed beautiful.

1066
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:34,378
You look beautiful now.

1067
01:25:36,506 --> 01:25:39,592
We need this cure.

1068
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:08,663
Cuba.

1069
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:10,289
Russia, America.

1070
01:26:10,374 --> 01:26:12,333
It makes no difference.

1071
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:15,378
Shaw has declared war on
mankind, on all of us.

1072
01:26:15,462 --> 01:26:16,462
He has to be stopped.

1073
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:19,590
I'm not going to stop Shaw.

1074
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:21,592
I'm going to kill him.

1075
01:26:24,763 --> 01:26:27,306
Do you have it in
you to allow that?

1076
01:26:33,063 --> 01:26:35,439
You've known all along
why I was here, Charles.

1077
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:38,150
But things have changed.

1078
01:26:38,235 --> 01:26:40,194
What started as a covert mission,

1079
01:26:40,278 --> 01:26:43,030
tomorrow, mankind will
know that mutants exist.

1080
01:26:43,115 --> 01:26:46,200
Shaw, us, they won't differentiate.

1081
01:26:46,284 --> 01:26:47,868
They'll fear us.

1082
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:49,829
And that fear will turn to hatred.

1083
01:26:50,163 --> 01:26:51,998
Not if we stop a war.

1084
01:26:52,082 --> 01:26:53,374
Not if we can prevent Shaw.

1085
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:55,376
Not if we risk our lives doing so.

1086
01:26:55,502 --> 01:26:56,702
Would they do the same for us?

1087
01:26:56,753 --> 01:26:58,629
We have it in us to
be the better men.

1088
01:26:58,714 --> 01:27:00,673
We already are.

1089
01:27:00,757 --> 01:27:02,383
We're the next stage
of human evolution.

1090
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:04,510
You said it yourself! No...

1091
01:27:04,594 --> 01:27:06,387
Are you really so naive

1092
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:09,807
as to think that they won't
battle their own extinction?

1093
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:12,018
Or is it arrogance?

1094
01:27:12,102 --> 01:27:13,477
I'm sorry?

1095
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:15,938
After tomorrow, they're
going to turn on us.

1096
01:27:16,023 --> 01:27:19,275
But you're blind to it, because you
believe they're all like moira.

1097
01:27:19,693 --> 01:27:21,652
And you believe they're
all like Shaw.

1098
01:27:24,197 --> 01:27:28,242
Listen to me very
carefully, my friend.

1099
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:31,245
Killing Shaw will not
bring you peace.

1100
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:35,541
Peace was never an option.

1101
01:28:21,755 --> 01:28:23,005
No.

1102
01:28:24,466 --> 01:28:25,883
No, no. No.

1103
01:28:54,913 --> 01:28:56,705
Well,

1104
01:28:58,333 --> 01:28:59,792
this is a surprise.

1105
01:29:00,085 --> 01:29:01,544
The nice kind?

1106
01:29:03,463 --> 01:29:07,007
Get out, raven. I
want to go to bed.

1107
01:29:07,092 --> 01:29:09,552
Maybe in a few years.

1108
01:29:13,515 --> 01:29:15,141
How about now?

1109
01:29:20,063 --> 01:29:21,605
I prefer the real raven.

1110
01:29:25,569 --> 01:29:28,988
I said the real raven.

1111
01:29:37,956 --> 01:29:39,248
Perfection.

1112
01:29:43,879 --> 01:29:45,379
Could you pass me my robe?

1113
01:29:45,672 --> 01:29:47,882
You don't have to hide.

1114
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:53,637
Have you ever looked at a tiger

1115
01:29:53,847 --> 01:29:56,640
and thought you ought
to cover it up?

1116
01:29:58,018 --> 01:29:59,518
No, but...

1117
01:29:59,728 --> 01:30:02,062
You're an exquisite
creature, raven.

1118
01:30:03,607 --> 01:30:06,108
All your life, the world
has tried to tame you.

1119
01:30:06,943 --> 01:30:08,569
It's time for you to be free.

1120
01:30:29,382 --> 01:30:31,550
You know, sometimes I wonder
what my life would have been like

1121
01:30:31,635 --> 01:30:33,928
if you hadn't found
me here that night.

1122
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:35,471
Sorry, what? You...

1123
01:30:37,682 --> 01:30:39,516
For God's sake, raven!

1124
01:30:39,601 --> 01:30:41,852
Where are your clothes?
Put some clothes on.

1125
01:30:41,937 --> 01:30:43,812
That's not what you said
when you first saw me.

1126
01:30:44,606 --> 01:30:48,150
But I guess pets are always cuter
when they're little, right?

1127
01:30:48,235 --> 01:30:50,195
Raven, I don't know what's
gotten into you lately.

1128
01:30:50,612 --> 01:30:52,071
I thought you'd be in a good mood.

1129
01:30:52,614 --> 01:30:58,077
Hank, he tells me that he's found the
answer to your cosmetic problem.

1130
01:30:59,537 --> 01:31:00,704
Are you gonna tell
me what's the matter

1131
01:31:00,789 --> 01:31:02,029
or do I have to read your mind?

1132
01:31:02,499 --> 01:31:04,166
You promised me you
would never do that.

1133
01:31:04,251 --> 01:31:05,918
Until recently,

1134
01:31:06,002 --> 01:31:08,837
I never had to use my power to know
what you were thinking, raven.

1135
01:31:08,922 --> 01:31:12,758
Charles, I used to think it was going
to be you and me against the world.

1136
01:31:12,842 --> 01:31:14,385
But no matter how
bad the world gets,

1137
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:16,178
you don't want to be
against it, do you?

1138
01:31:16,263 --> 01:31:17,384
You want to be a part of it.

1139
01:31:39,911 --> 01:31:41,078
What the hell happened here?

1140
01:31:49,587 --> 01:31:51,380
Hank has been busy.

1141
01:31:51,464 --> 01:31:53,632
Do we really have to wear these?

1142
01:31:53,717 --> 01:31:56,468
As none of us mutated to
endure extreme g-force

1143
01:31:56,553 --> 01:31:59,805
or being riddled by bullets,
I suggest we suit up.

1144
01:32:24,289 --> 01:32:25,622
Where is Hank?

1145
01:32:27,459 --> 01:32:28,959
I'm here.

1146
01:32:38,428 --> 01:32:40,220
Hank?

1147
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:48,479
It didn't attack the cells.

1148
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:52,024
It enhanced them.

1149
01:32:52,108 --> 01:32:53,400
It didn't work.

1150
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:56,653
Yes, it did, Hank.
Don't you see?

1151
01:32:56,988 --> 01:33:00,157
This is who you were meant to be.

1152
01:33:00,533 --> 01:33:01,867
This is you.

1153
01:33:04,037 --> 01:33:05,371
No more hiding.

1154
01:33:06,331 --> 01:33:08,665
You never looked better, man.
Hank!

1155
01:33:10,502 --> 01:33:12,795
Don't mock me!

1156
01:33:12,879 --> 01:33:14,759
Hank, put him
down immediately, please.

1157
01:33:14,881 --> 01:33:15,923
Hank! Hank!

1158
01:33:18,927 --> 01:33:20,344
I wasn't.

1159
01:33:20,762 --> 01:33:22,471
Even I got to admit you
look pretty badass.

1160
01:33:23,014 --> 01:33:24,473
I think I got a new name for you.

1161
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:26,433
Beast.

1162
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:30,521
You're sure you can fly this thing?

1163
01:33:30,688 --> 01:33:33,357
Of course I can. I designed it.

1164
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:47,162
Status of
the cargo ship.

1165
01:33:47,247 --> 01:33:50,791
Bearing
1-8-0 at 12 knots.

1166
01:33:52,585 --> 01:33:54,878
Three minutes to the
embargo line, sir.

1167
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:58,799
God help them if they cross it.

1168
01:34:00,510 --> 01:34:01,718
God help us all.

1169
01:34:02,429 --> 01:34:03,804
Sound general quarters.

1170
01:34:03,888 --> 01:34:05,472
General quarters, general quarters!

1171
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:08,561
- All hands, man battle stations!
- Aye, sir.

1172
01:34:08,643 --> 01:34:10,227
Set condition zebra!

1173
01:34:10,895 --> 01:34:12,938
General
quarters, battle stations.

1174
01:34:24,117 --> 01:34:29,079
Captain, we already have our
orders. Why so eager for new ones?

1175
01:34:29,539 --> 01:34:33,041
I lived through one war, comrade.

1176
01:34:34,377 --> 01:34:36,587
I'd prefer not to start another.

1177
01:34:38,965 --> 01:34:41,175
Battle stations! Now!

1178
01:34:43,845 --> 01:34:48,765
Gun boss, target cargo
ship bearing 1-8-0.

1179
01:34:50,810 --> 01:34:53,645
Fleet reports all weapons ready.

1180
01:34:54,105 --> 01:34:55,939
From the kremlin, sir.

1181
01:34:56,483 --> 01:35:00,444
New orders. As of 1025 hours, the cargo
vessel aral sea is hereby ordered to...

1182
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:03,113
Reverse course and return
to port in Odessa.

1183
01:35:03,281 --> 01:35:07,284
Aral sea, come in.

1184
01:35:08,453 --> 01:35:09,870
They are not responding.

1185
01:35:09,954 --> 01:35:11,121
She's not turning around.

1186
01:35:11,372 --> 01:35:13,957
Aral sea, you are
ordered to turn around.

1187
01:35:14,292 --> 01:35:15,626
Do not cross the line.

1188
01:35:16,794 --> 01:35:18,754
Target ready to be fired upon, sir.

1189
01:35:18,838 --> 01:35:21,798
Stand by to fire. Standing by, sir.

1190
01:35:29,432 --> 01:35:30,849
Whoa!

1191
01:35:34,312 --> 01:35:36,897
It looks pretty messy out there.

1192
01:35:47,158 --> 01:35:49,618
Aral sea you are ordered
to turn around.

1193
01:35:50,537 --> 01:35:53,247
The crew of the aral sea are
all dead. Shaw's been there.

1194
01:35:53,331 --> 01:35:54,831
He's still here, somewhere.

1195
01:35:54,916 --> 01:35:56,792
He set the ship on course
for the embargo line.

1196
01:35:56,876 --> 01:35:58,085
If that ship crosses the line,

1197
01:35:58,169 --> 01:35:59,753
our boys are going to blow it up.

1198
01:35:59,837 --> 01:36:01,505
And the war begins.

1199
01:36:01,923 --> 01:36:03,423
Unless they're not our boys.

1200
01:36:06,427 --> 01:36:08,971
USS independence, this
is Alexander nevsky.

1201
01:36:09,055 --> 01:36:10,847
We have lost control
of our cargo ship.

1202
01:36:10,932 --> 01:36:12,599
She has been instructed to stop.

1203
01:36:12,684 --> 01:36:15,560
Do not fire! Repeat,
do not fire!

1204
01:36:15,645 --> 01:36:19,022
They have signaled the cargo
ship to turn around, sir.

1205
01:36:19,107 --> 01:36:21,483
It's a ruse. Pay no attention!

1206
01:36:21,859 --> 01:36:24,444
Stand by to fire.
Standing by to fire, sir.

1207
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:26,697
On my count. Five,

1208
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:28,573
four...

1209
01:36:50,888 --> 01:36:52,347
Hold on!

1210
01:37:01,733 --> 01:37:02,858
Nyet.

1211
01:37:07,196 --> 01:37:09,156
What was that? The Russians.

1212
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:10,657
They have fired on
their own ship.

1213
01:37:11,409 --> 01:37:12,909
A little warning next
time, Professor.

1214
01:37:13,286 --> 01:37:16,204
Sorry about that. You all right?
Yeah.

1215
01:37:16,914 --> 01:37:18,415
Son of a...

1216
01:37:18,499 --> 01:37:21,001
Give me cinclant on the horn.
I want a new set of orders.

1217
01:37:25,006 --> 01:37:27,090
Congratulations, comrade.

1218
01:37:27,425 --> 01:37:31,261
You just averted nuclear war!

1219
01:37:31,846 --> 01:37:33,221
What?

1220
01:37:33,306 --> 01:37:34,973
Take him to the brig.

1221
01:37:35,058 --> 01:37:38,727
What?
What just happened?

1222
01:37:38,811 --> 01:37:40,771
They say the comrade lost his mind.

1223
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:43,607
The Americans are applauding.

1224
01:37:44,609 --> 01:37:48,153
They're here. That
telepath is powerful.

1225
01:37:50,323 --> 01:37:53,033
We're moving to a back-up plan.

1226
01:37:54,827 --> 01:37:56,244
That was inspired, Charles.

1227
01:37:56,329 --> 01:37:58,372
Thank you very much, but I
still can't locate Shaw.

1228
01:37:58,456 --> 01:38:00,499
He's down there. We
need to find him now.

1229
01:38:00,583 --> 01:38:01,583
Hank?

1230
01:38:01,667 --> 01:38:04,002
Is there anything unusual
on the radar or scanners?

1231
01:38:04,087 --> 01:38:05,670
No. Nothing.

1232
01:38:06,798 --> 01:38:08,382
Well, then he must be underwater.

1233
01:38:08,466 --> 01:38:10,050
And obviously, we don't have sonar.

1234
01:38:12,595 --> 01:38:15,180
Yes, we do. Yes, we do.

1235
01:38:19,977 --> 01:38:21,137
They are ready for war.

1236
01:38:21,354 --> 01:38:23,980
We just need to strike another
match to light the fuse.

1237
01:38:24,315 --> 01:38:27,150
And we still have the most
powerful weapon of all.

1238
01:38:27,902 --> 01:38:28,944
Me.

1239
01:38:29,278 --> 01:38:34,157
Turn the nuclear reactor to 100% output
and make sure I'm not disturbed.

1240
01:38:37,537 --> 01:38:39,579
Hank, level the bloody plane!

1241
01:38:44,752 --> 01:38:47,003
Whoa! You back right off.

1242
01:38:48,214 --> 01:38:50,006
Beast, open the bomb bay doors!

1243
01:38:58,349 --> 01:39:01,309
Remember! This is a muscle.

1244
01:39:01,394 --> 01:39:03,019
You control it!

1245
01:39:03,104 --> 01:39:05,439
You'll be in here
the entire time!

1246
01:39:05,690 --> 01:39:07,190
We'll see you soon!

1247
01:39:07,275 --> 01:39:10,777
On my mark! Three! Two!

1248
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:12,863
One! Go!

1249
01:39:29,547 --> 01:39:31,798
Alert the fleet, they may
want to take their cans off.

1250
01:39:45,062 --> 01:39:47,606
Banshee has got a
location on Shaw.

1251
01:39:49,609 --> 01:39:50,942
Are you ready for this?

1252
01:39:51,027 --> 01:39:52,319
Let's find out.

1253
01:40:56,092 --> 01:40:58,885
Remember, the
point between rage

1254
01:40:59,178 --> 01:41:01,304
and serenity.

1255
01:42:24,555 --> 01:42:25,722
Erik, take my hand!

1256
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:27,515
Oh.

1257
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:30,268
Hold on, guys. It's
gonna get bumpy.

1258
01:42:45,743 --> 01:42:47,077
Erik, take my hand!

1259
01:43:38,421 --> 01:43:40,046
Moira? Moira, are you all right?

1260
01:43:40,131 --> 01:43:41,923
Yeah, I'm okay.

1261
01:43:46,053 --> 01:43:47,804
I read the teleporter's mind.

1262
01:43:47,888 --> 01:43:49,806
Shaw is drawing all the
power out of his sub.

1263
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:51,975
He's turning himself into
some kind of nuclear bomb.

1264
01:43:52,101 --> 01:43:54,342
We got no time. The geiger
count is going out of control.

1265
01:43:54,395 --> 01:43:55,520
Moira, this is what
we're gonna do.

1266
01:43:55,604 --> 01:43:58,314
Get on the radio and tell them to
clear both fleets out immediately.

1267
01:43:58,315 --> 01:44:00,692
I'm going in. Beast,
havok, back him up.

1268
01:44:00,776 --> 01:44:02,736
Erik, I can guide you
through once you're in,

1269
01:44:02,820 --> 01:44:05,280
but I need you to shut down
whatever it is that's blocking me,

1270
01:44:05,364 --> 01:44:07,407
then we just hope to God it's not
too late for me to stop him.

1271
01:44:07,491 --> 01:44:09,492
Got it. Good luck!

1272
01:44:09,577 --> 01:44:11,286
Raven, stop! I'm
going to help them.

1273
01:44:11,370 --> 01:44:12,495
We don't have time for this.

1274
01:44:12,496 --> 01:44:13,580
If anything comes in that entrance,

1275
01:44:13,664 --> 01:44:15,290
you're taking care of it, yes?

1276
01:44:15,374 --> 01:44:16,499
Fine.

1277
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:34,184
Beast!

1278
01:44:37,730 --> 01:44:39,439
If we go, you go!

1279
01:44:42,985 --> 01:44:45,195
We believe Shaw is trying to
detonate some kind of bomb.

1280
01:44:50,451 --> 01:44:52,911
Erik, make for the
middle of the vessel.

1281
01:44:52,995 --> 01:44:54,596
That's the point my
mind can't penetrate.

1282
01:44:54,663 --> 01:44:56,873
We have to assume that
that's where Shaw is.

1283
01:45:05,716 --> 01:45:07,675
Gangway! Gangway! Gangway!

1284
01:45:14,683 --> 01:45:17,435
That's the nuclear reactor.
Disable it.

1285
01:45:29,907 --> 01:45:31,908
Stop! Don't move!

1286
01:45:39,667 --> 01:45:40,917
Get down!

1287
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:05,942
Erik, you're there.
You've reached the void.

1288
01:46:06,026 --> 01:46:08,611
He's not here, Charles. Shaw's
not here! He's left the sub!

1289
01:46:08,821 --> 01:46:10,697
What? He's got to be there.
He has to be!

1290
01:46:10,781 --> 01:46:12,574
There's nowhere else he can be.
Keep looking.

1291
01:46:12,575 --> 01:46:16,202
And I'm telling you he's not.
There's no one here, God damn it!

1292
01:46:19,248 --> 01:46:20,957
Erik.

1293
01:46:21,417 --> 01:46:22,876
What a pleasant surprise.

1294
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:24,460
Erik? Erik.

1295
01:46:27,172 --> 01:46:28,923
So good to see you again.

1296
01:46:45,649 --> 01:46:48,860
May I ask you something?

1297
01:46:48,944 --> 01:46:50,612
Why are you on their side?

1298
01:46:50,696 --> 01:46:51,821
He's gone. What?

1299
01:46:51,906 --> 01:46:54,782
He's gone into the void! I can't
communicate with him there.

1300
01:46:54,867 --> 01:46:57,452
Why fight for a doomed
race who will hunt us down

1301
01:46:57,536 --> 01:47:00,496
as soon as they realize their
reign is coming to an end?

1302
01:47:29,318 --> 01:47:31,444
Yeah! Yes!

1303
01:47:44,458 --> 01:47:46,376
I'm sorry for what
happened in the camps.

1304
01:47:48,629 --> 01:47:50,463
I truly am.

1305
01:47:58,722 --> 01:48:01,975
He's back! Erik, whatever
you're doing, keep doing it.

1306
01:48:02,059 --> 01:48:04,060
It's starting to work.

1307
01:48:04,186 --> 01:48:07,063
But everything I
did, I did for you.

1308
01:48:07,564 --> 01:48:09,232
To unlock your power,

1309
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:11,734
to make you embrace it.

1310
01:48:15,072 --> 01:48:16,197
It's working!

1311
01:48:16,281 --> 01:48:18,700
I'm starting to see him, but
I can't yet touch his mind.

1312
01:48:33,090 --> 01:48:35,842
You've come a long way
from bending gates.

1313
01:48:35,926 --> 01:48:37,635
I'm so proud of you.

1314
01:48:45,602 --> 01:48:48,062
And you're just starting
to scratch the surface.

1315
01:48:48,439 --> 01:48:51,482
Think how much further we could go

1316
01:48:51,567 --> 01:48:53,526
together.

1317
01:49:04,121 --> 01:49:05,204
Look out!

1318
01:49:12,463 --> 01:49:14,464
Stop! Azazel.

1319
01:49:29,730 --> 01:49:32,440
I don't want to hurt you, Erik.
I never did.

1320
01:49:32,524 --> 01:49:34,150
I want to help you.

1321
01:49:34,359 --> 01:49:36,486
This is our time.

1322
01:49:36,612 --> 01:49:38,321
Our age.

1323
01:49:38,989 --> 01:49:43,201
We are the future
of the human race.

1324
01:49:43,285 --> 01:49:45,787
You and me, son.

1325
01:49:45,871 --> 01:49:48,372
This world could be ours.

1326
01:49:49,917 --> 01:49:53,878
Everything you did
made me stronger.

1327
01:49:54,797 --> 01:49:57,507
It made me the weapon I am today.

1328
01:49:59,009 --> 01:50:01,010
It's the truth.

1329
01:50:01,929 --> 01:50:04,305
I've known it all along.

1330
01:50:09,978 --> 01:50:11,938
You are my creator.

1331
01:50:12,689 --> 01:50:14,190
Now, Charles!

1332
01:50:15,734 --> 01:50:17,610
Are you okay? Moira, be quiet.

1333
01:50:17,694 --> 01:50:19,487
I can only control
this man for so long.

1334
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:34,919
- Sorry, Charles.
- Erik, please.

1335
01:50:35,212 --> 01:50:36,295
Be the better man.

1336
01:50:36,380 --> 01:50:37,630
It's not that I don't trust you.

1337
01:50:37,631 --> 01:50:39,423
Erik, there will be
no turning back!

1338
01:50:40,884 --> 01:50:42,301
No!

1339
01:50:43,053 --> 01:50:44,887
Charles!
Don't do this, Erik!

1340
01:50:52,229 --> 01:50:53,729
If you're in there,

1341
01:50:53,856 --> 01:50:56,899
I'd like you to know that I
agree with every word you said.

1342
01:50:59,570 --> 01:51:01,571
We are the future.

1343
01:51:03,448 --> 01:51:04,490
But,

1344
01:51:06,535 --> 01:51:07,869
unfortunately,

1345
01:51:08,662 --> 01:51:11,080
you killed my mother.

1346
01:51:19,214 --> 01:51:20,673
This is what we're going to do.

1347
01:51:20,757 --> 01:51:23,092
No. Please, Erik, no.

1348
01:51:23,177 --> 01:51:27,054
I'm going to count to three and
I'm going to move the coin.

1349
01:51:29,099 --> 01:51:30,766
One.

1350
01:51:31,977 --> 01:51:33,769
Please, Erik.

1351
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:43,446
Two.

1352
01:51:49,953 --> 01:51:51,662
Three.

1353
01:52:20,067 --> 01:52:22,902
The Russians
share our concerns

1354
01:52:22,986 --> 01:52:25,988
and will join a strike
on all the mutants.

1355
01:52:26,073 --> 01:52:28,074
We can end this threat for good.

1356
01:52:28,158 --> 01:52:30,076
We'll never have another
opportunity like this.

1357
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:32,078
We have an agent on that beach.

1358
01:52:32,162 --> 01:52:34,038
One agent.

1359
01:52:34,164 --> 01:52:35,498
She's a good agent.

1360
01:52:35,582 --> 01:52:37,792
She's collateral damage.

1361
01:52:43,298 --> 01:52:46,676
Today, our fighting stops!

1362
01:53:09,825 --> 01:53:12,285
Take off your blinders,
brothers and sisters.

1363
01:53:13,036 --> 01:53:14,787
The real enemy is out there.

1364
01:53:16,748 --> 01:53:18,791
I feel their guns
moving in the water,

1365
01:53:19,251 --> 01:53:21,544
their metal targeting us.

1366
01:53:21,753 --> 01:53:24,130
Americans, Soviets,

1367
01:53:24,298 --> 01:53:25,881
humans.

1368
01:53:26,508 --> 01:53:29,051
United in their fear
of the unknown.

1369
01:53:30,220 --> 01:53:33,973
The neanderthal is running
scared, my fellow mutants!

1370
01:53:36,226 --> 01:53:37,310
Go ahead, Charles.

1371
01:53:39,896 --> 01:53:41,063
Tell me I'm wrong.

1372
01:54:01,501 --> 01:54:04,337
Fleet commander, this
is X-ray bravo 7-0.

1373
01:54:04,421 --> 01:54:06,839
Respond. Over.

1374
01:54:06,923 --> 01:54:09,258
The beach is secure.
Call off the attack.

1375
01:54:09,551 --> 01:54:11,969
The beach is targeted and
ready to be fired upon, sir.

1376
01:54:12,054 --> 01:54:14,347
Stand by. Standing by, sir.

1377
01:54:14,556 --> 01:54:16,307
New orders. Fire on the beach.

1378
01:54:18,477 --> 01:54:20,061
Hello?

1379
01:54:21,605 --> 01:54:23,564
Hello!

1380
01:54:30,364 --> 01:54:33,115
Fire!

1381
01:55:21,706 --> 01:55:24,166
Erik, you said yourself,
we're the better men.

1382
01:55:24,835 --> 01:55:26,419
This is the time to prove it.

1383
01:55:30,173 --> 01:55:32,258
There are thousands of
men on those ships.

1384
01:55:32,342 --> 01:55:34,593
Good, honest, innocent men!

1385
01:55:34,678 --> 01:55:36,470
They're just following orders.

1386
01:55:38,390 --> 01:55:40,641
I've been at the mercy of
men just following orders.

1387
01:55:45,689 --> 01:55:47,189
Never again.

1388
01:55:51,486 --> 01:55:52,903
Erik, release them!

1389
01:55:59,744 --> 01:56:01,537
No!

1390
01:56:07,586 --> 01:56:10,045
I don't want to hurt you.
Don't make me!

1391
01:56:10,881 --> 01:56:11,964
Stand back!

1392
01:56:14,718 --> 01:56:16,010
Charles, that's enough!

1393
01:56:21,057 --> 01:56:22,183
Erik, stop!

1394
01:56:32,569 --> 01:56:34,778
Gentlemen, it's been an
honor serving with you.

1395
01:56:34,988 --> 01:56:37,490
Comrades, thank you
for your service.

1396
01:57:24,996 --> 01:57:26,288
I'm so sorry.

1397
01:57:26,373 --> 01:57:28,415
I said back off!

1398
01:57:29,918 --> 01:57:32,211
You. You did this.

1399
01:57:36,216 --> 01:57:38,717
Erik. Please.

1400
01:57:40,887 --> 01:57:43,889
She didn't do this, Erik.

1401
01:57:43,974 --> 01:57:45,975
You did.

1402
01:57:52,482 --> 01:57:56,151
Us turning on each other,
it's what they want.

1403
01:57:56,653 --> 01:57:59,488
I tried to warn you, Charles.

1404
01:58:01,283 --> 01:58:03,742
I want you by my side.

1405
01:58:03,827 --> 01:58:05,786
We're brothers, you and I.

1406
01:58:06,079 --> 01:58:09,290
All of us together,
protecting each other.

1407
01:58:11,209 --> 01:58:13,544
We want the same thing.

1408
01:58:14,129 --> 01:58:16,046
My friend.

1409
01:58:16,506 --> 01:58:20,342
I'm sorry, but we do not.

1410
01:58:36,109 --> 01:58:39,903
Charles! I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1411
01:58:39,988 --> 01:58:42,489
It's all right.
It's all right.

1412
01:58:46,036 --> 01:58:48,370
This society won't accept us.

1413
01:58:49,456 --> 01:58:50,956
We form our own.

1414
01:58:51,374 --> 01:58:54,209
The humans have played their hand.

1415
01:58:55,879 --> 01:58:58,422
Now we get ready to play ours.

1416
01:59:00,884 --> 01:59:01,967
Who's with me?

1417
01:59:13,605 --> 01:59:15,022
No more hiding.

1418
01:59:43,009 --> 01:59:44,301
You should go with him.

1419
01:59:44,969 --> 01:59:46,345
It's what you want.

1420
01:59:46,888 --> 01:59:49,264
You promised me you would
never read my mind.

1421
01:59:49,683 --> 01:59:51,100
I know.

1422
01:59:51,184 --> 01:59:53,435
I promised you a great
many things, I'm afraid.

1423
01:59:54,521 --> 01:59:55,646
I'm sorry.

1424
02:00:00,985 --> 02:00:03,112
Take care of him.

1425
02:00:17,919 --> 02:00:21,004
And, beast, never forget.

1426
02:00:21,715 --> 02:00:25,008
Mutant and proud.

1427
02:00:33,393 --> 02:00:35,185
Help
me out, come on.

1428
02:00:35,687 --> 02:00:37,521
I'm gonna get you to a hospital.

1429
02:00:37,605 --> 02:00:39,314
Wait, Charles.

1430
02:00:39,399 --> 02:00:41,066
Charles, don't move, okay?

1431
02:00:41,151 --> 02:00:42,943
I won't.

1432
02:00:43,027 --> 02:00:44,862
Actually...

1433
02:00:48,158 --> 02:00:50,242
I can't feel my legs.

1434
02:00:51,202 --> 02:00:53,579
What? I can't feel my legs.

1435
02:00:55,165 --> 02:00:57,166
I can't feel my legs.

1436
02:01:08,845 --> 02:01:10,596
In this
week of Thanksgiving

1437
02:01:10,680 --> 02:01:12,639
there is much for which
we can be grateful

1438
02:01:12,724 --> 02:01:16,185
as we look back to where we
stood only four weeks ago.

1439
02:01:16,269 --> 02:01:19,688
The unity of this hemisphere,
the support of our allies

1440
02:01:19,773 --> 02:01:22,608
and the calm determination
of the American people.

1441
02:01:22,692 --> 02:01:26,445
These qualities may be tested
many more times in this decade.

1442
02:01:29,699 --> 02:01:32,409
So, how many students
do you think you'll have here

1443
02:01:32,494 --> 02:01:34,787
once you get the academy
up and running?

1444
02:01:34,871 --> 02:01:37,039
As many as I can manage.

1445
02:01:37,123 --> 02:01:38,957
Possibly more.

1446
02:01:41,544 --> 02:01:42,628
You know,

1447
02:01:43,546 --> 02:01:45,380
one day the government
is going to realize

1448
02:01:45,465 --> 02:01:47,883
how lucky they were to have
Professor x on their side.

1449
02:01:49,677 --> 02:01:52,137
I suppose I am a real
Professor now, aren't I?

1450
02:01:52,222 --> 02:01:53,783
Next thing you know,
I'll be going bald.

1451
02:01:55,475 --> 02:01:57,935
We're still on the
government's side, moira.

1452
02:01:58,353 --> 02:02:00,562
We're still g-men.
Just without the "g".

1453
02:02:01,356 --> 02:02:04,775
No. You're your own team now.

1454
02:02:04,943 --> 02:02:06,401
It's better.

1455
02:02:07,195 --> 02:02:09,404
You're X-Men.

1456
02:02:11,115 --> 02:02:13,158
Yes, I like the sound of that.

1457
02:02:14,077 --> 02:02:15,369
Moira?

1458
02:02:15,870 --> 02:02:19,748
For us, anonymity will be
the first line of defense.

1459
02:02:20,542 --> 02:02:22,000
I know.

1460
02:02:23,086 --> 02:02:27,631
They can threaten me all
they want, Charles.

1461
02:02:27,715 --> 02:02:30,551
I'll never tell them where you are.

1462
02:02:30,635 --> 02:02:32,511
Ever.

1463
02:02:32,595 --> 02:02:34,555
I know you won't.

1464
02:02:35,932 --> 02:02:37,349
I know.

1465
02:02:44,816 --> 02:02:47,651
I remember the attack on hq,

1466
02:02:47,735 --> 02:02:50,028
leaving to go somewhere else.

1467
02:02:50,113 --> 02:02:54,157
And then this morning,
I woke up at home.

1468
02:02:54,242 --> 02:02:56,368
That's it.

1469
02:02:56,452 --> 02:02:59,955
All that time, wiped clean
from your mind. Just gone.

1470
02:03:00,623 --> 02:03:02,457
He can do that? You don't
remember anything?

1471
02:03:03,209 --> 02:03:05,460
Sometimes I get fragments.

1472
02:03:05,628 --> 02:03:07,421
Like

1473
02:03:07,505 --> 02:03:09,548
trees,

1474
02:03:09,632 --> 02:03:11,091
sunlight.

1475
02:03:12,969 --> 02:03:14,011
A kiss.

1476
02:03:14,095 --> 02:03:16,221
Oh, Jesus.

1477
02:03:16,306 --> 02:03:19,558
<i>Gentlemen, this is why the
CIA is no place for a woman.</i>

1478
02:03:24,439 --> 02:03:25,564
What the hell was that?

1479
02:03:42,498 --> 02:03:45,208
I know we've had our differences.

1480
02:03:47,587 --> 02:03:49,755
Where's your telepath friend?

1481
02:03:50,381 --> 02:03:52,507
Gone.

1482
02:03:52,592 --> 02:03:55,510
Left a bit of a gap in my
life, if I'm to be honest.

1483
02:03:55,595 --> 02:03:58,388
I was rather hoping
you would fill it.

1484
02:04:02,685 --> 02:04:03,936
Join us.

1485
02:04:11,402 --> 02:04:12,736
Erik, I believe.

1486
02:04:16,699 --> 02:04:18,367
I prefer

1487
02:04:20,203 --> 02:04:21,828
Magneto.
