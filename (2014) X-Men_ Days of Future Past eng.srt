00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,502

they discovered the secrets

124

 to her powers of
transformation.

125
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,589
 It gave them

A darker path.

168
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,871
It's going to take the two
of us, side by side...

169
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,666
at a time when we couldn't
be further apart.

170

Great.

00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,840
So where do I find you?

172
00:15:25,173 --> 00:15:26,675
Well, it's complicated.

173
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,763
Basically, your body
will go to sleep

174
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,016
while your mind
travels back in time.

175
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,220
As long as
you're back there,

176
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,395
past and present will
continue to coexist.

177
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,188
But once you wake up...

178
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:44,234
whatever you've done will
take hold and become history.

179
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:47,446
And for the rest of us, it will
be the only history that we know.

180
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,907
It will be like the last
50 years never happened.

181
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:53,577
And this world,
and this war...

182
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:57,122
the only person who will
remember it is you.

183

All right, Logan...

184
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,543
I need you to
clear your head

185
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,295
and to stay as
calm as possible.

186
00:16:03,378 --> 00:16:04,880
What? What do you mean?

187
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:07,341
If your mind gets rocky, it will
be harder for me to hold you...

188
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,801
and you could start to slip
between past and future.

189
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,887
What if I need to
get a little rocky?

190
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,306
Think peaceful thoughts?

191
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:17,309
Peaceful thoughts...
Do you have any good news?

192
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,103
Well, you don't really age,

193

much look the same.

as our salvation.
