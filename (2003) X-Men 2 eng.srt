1
00:00:41,314 --> 00:00:44,454
Mutants. Since the discovery
of their existence,

2
00:00:44,554 --> 00:00:49,503
they have been regarded
with fear, suspicion, often hatred.

3
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:51,804
Across the planet debate rages.

4
00:00:51,874 --> 00:00:55,134
Are mutants the next link
in the evolutionary chain?

5
00:00:55,234 --> 00:01:00,547
Or simply a new species of humanity,
fighting for their share of the world?

6
00:01:00,674 --> 00:01:03,552
Either way, it is an historical fact

7
00:01:03,674 --> 00:01:09,351
sharing the world has never been
humanity's defining attribute.

8
00:01:51,071 --> 00:01:55,349
'We are not enemies, but friends.
We must not be enemies.'

9
00:01:55,471 --> 00:02:00,611
'Though passion may have strained,
it must not break the bonds of our affection.'

10
00:02:00,711 --> 00:02:05,451
Lincoln said that in his first inaugural
address as our nation's 16th president.

11
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:07,940
It's one of my favorites.

12
00:02:08,071 --> 00:02:13,191
If you'll please have your tickets ready,
we can begin the tour.

13
00:02:19,535 --> 00:02:23,075
Jackie, clear my schedule.
I'm having dinner with my son.

14
00:02:23,175 --> 00:02:25,175
Yes, Mr. President.

15
00:02:52,611 --> 00:02:54,886
Excuse me, sir. Are you lost?

16
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,639
Perimeter breach at visitors' checkpoint.

17
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:14,109
Multiple subjects.

18
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:18,759
Mr. President, security breach.
Jackie, leave. Get him to the car.

19
00:03:20,662 --> 00:03:22,322
Exits not clear. Unknown how many.

20
00:03:22,422 --> 00:03:24,422
Both sides secure.

21
00:03:33,302 --> 00:03:35,722
Something's in the corridor.
- To the shelter.

22
00:03:35,822 --> 00:03:37,822
Not clear.

23
00:03:44,473 --> 00:03:48,591
It's outside the Oval Office.
- Lock this place down.

24
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:06,069
Don't shoot!

25
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,300
My God.

26
00:07:12,608 --> 00:07:17,148
Neanderthals. We once believed that
they were wiped out by years of conflict

27
00:07:17,248 --> 00:07:21,308
with the much more advanced branch
of humanity called Cro-Magnon man,

28
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:27,324
but recent research into our DNA suggests
that these two species may have interbred,

29
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,070
evolving into modern humans.
In other words, into what?

30
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:34,339
Us.
- That's right.

31
00:07:36,024 --> 00:07:37,284
Artie.

32
00:07:37,384 --> 00:07:39,384
Not here.

33
00:07:45,544 --> 00:07:47,739
Come on. Pay attention.

34
00:08:02,397 --> 00:08:05,275
...makes me insane when she does this...

35
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:09,428
What are you looking at? Sick...

36
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,673
To the shelter.

37
00:08:13,797 --> 00:08:15,913
They're gonna kill him.

38
00:08:23,926 --> 00:08:25,926
Jean? You OK?

39
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,725
Yeah, I'm fine.

40
00:08:28,846 --> 00:08:31,599
It's just a headache.

41
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:36,347
It's not just a headache, is it?

42
00:08:36,478 --> 00:08:40,138
I wasn't sure how to say this,
but since Liberty Island you've been...

43
00:08:40,238 --> 00:08:42,911
Scott.
- You've been different.

44
00:08:44,578 --> 00:08:48,158
My telepathy's been off lately.
I can't focus. I hear everything.

45
00:08:48,258 --> 00:08:53,478
Jean, it's not just your telepathy. A month ago
you had to concentrate just to levitate a book.

46
00:08:53,578 --> 00:08:57,890
Now when you have a nightmare
the entire bedroom shakes.

47
00:08:59,841 --> 00:09:01,841
My dreams are getting worse.

48
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:09,491
I keep feeling
something terrible's about to happen.

49
00:09:14,815 --> 00:09:17,315
I would never let anything happen to you.

50
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:20,407
Have you guys seen Bobby and Rogue?

51
00:09:22,423 --> 00:09:24,523
Something's happening in the food court.

52
00:09:24,623 --> 00:09:27,043
It's a simple question.
- Why are you being a dick?

53
00:09:27,143 --> 00:09:29,043
Yeah, why are you being such a dick?

54
00:09:29,143 --> 00:09:31,143
Because I can.

55
00:09:33,274 --> 00:09:35,274
Can I have a light?

56
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,180
Sorry. Can't help you out, pal.
- John, knock it off.

57
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,980
Why don't you stop showing off?
- For her?

58
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,060
I can't help it if your girl's getting excited.
- She isn't.

59
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,340
We're trying to have a good time.
- You're the only one having a good time.

60
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:57,825
That's real cute, man.

61
00:09:57,949 --> 00:09:59,949
What are you gonna do?

62
00:10:01,749 --> 00:10:03,899
Suddenly you're not so tough.

63
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,519
Bobby, what did you do?

64
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,380
I didn't do this.

65
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,675
No. I did.

66
00:11:04,106 --> 00:11:07,606
And the next time
you feel like showing off, don't.

67
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,701
Breaking news.
- We're live from Washington,

68
00:11:14,824 --> 00:11:18,044
where there's been an attack
in the Oval Office of the White House.

69
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:23,394
We have been informed that the president
and vice president were not harmed.

70
00:11:23,424 --> 00:11:26,364
Sources say the attack involved
one or more mutants...

71
00:11:26,464 --> 00:11:30,734
I think it's time to leave, Professor.
- I think you're right.

72
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:45,891
In my opinion, Magneto's behind this.
- I don't think so, Scott.

73
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:49,211
While Eric could organize
something like this from prison,

74
00:11:49,311 --> 00:11:53,091
it would be irrational
and only hurt his goal of mutant prosperity.

75
00:11:53,418 --> 00:11:56,998
You mean superiority.
- You're right, if Eric had his way.

76
00:11:57,098 --> 00:12:01,478
And, of course, the government
will reintroduce the Registration Act.

77
00:12:02,109 --> 00:12:03,329
Or worse.

78
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:09,099
The president could declare a state of
emergency, place every mutant under arrest.

79
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:14,249
Do you think the assassin worked alone?
- We'll only know that if we find him first.

80
00:12:14,349 --> 00:12:20,663
I've been trying to track him using Cerebro,
but his movements are inexplicably erratic.

81
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:27,589
When I have exact coordinates, Storm, Jean,
I'll need you to take the jet and pick him up.

82
00:12:29,455 --> 00:12:32,253
It was close, wasn't it?

83
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,935
Closer than anyone's admitted.

84
00:12:35,314 --> 00:12:41,105
What do you need, William?
- Your authorization for a special operation.

85
00:12:41,234 --> 00:12:43,873
No, thank you, Mr. President.

86
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:47,431
I thought you were here
to talk about school reform.

87
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:50,401
Funny you should say that, Mr. President.

88
00:12:50,691 --> 00:12:54,286
Senator.
- Mr. President. Thank you for having me.

89
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,993
Senator Kelly, Colonel William Stryker.
- How do you do?

90
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,380
His department has been dealing with the
mutant phenomenon since before my time.

91
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,500
You were a staunch supporter
of the Registration Act,

92
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,900
but it seems your ideas on
the mutant problem have changed.

93
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,740
For the best, I hope.

94
00:13:12,676 --> 00:13:15,429
So what are you proposing, Mr. Stryker?

95
00:13:15,556 --> 00:13:17,751
May I, Mr. President?

96
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,520
We've managed to gather evidence
of a mutant training facility

97
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,010
in the Salem region of upstate New York.

98
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,160
Where did you get this information?

99
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:44,320
Interrogation of one of the mutant terrorists
from the Liberty Island incident.

100
00:13:45,063 --> 00:13:47,258
Eric Lehnsherr?

101
00:13:47,383 --> 00:13:50,216
You have access to him?
- Magneto, yes.

102
00:13:50,343 --> 00:13:55,417
We developed the technology
that built his plastic prison.

103
00:13:57,183 --> 00:14:00,892
This facility is a school.
- Sure it is.

104
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,246
What the hell is that?
- A jet.

105
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,362
What kind of jet?
- We don't know.

106
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:14,845
But it comes up out of the basketball court.

107
00:14:21,245 --> 00:14:24,425
If we'd been allowed to do our jobs
before this incident...

108
00:14:24,525 --> 00:14:26,720
All right, listen.

109
00:14:30,251 --> 00:14:33,401
William, you enter, you detain, you question,

110
00:14:33,451 --> 00:14:39,606
but the last thing we need to see is the body
of a mutant kid on the six o'clock news.

111
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,517
Mr. Stryker?
- Senator Kelly.

112
00:14:50,927 --> 00:14:54,078
This is Yuriko, my personal assistant.

113
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,547
Quite a handshake.
- What can I do for you?

114
00:14:57,272 --> 00:15:00,532
Eric Lehnsherr's prison.
I'd like to arrange a visit.

115
00:15:00,632 --> 00:15:02,692
It isn't a petting zoo, Senator.

116
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:07,492
In this conflict he is the enemy, you're just
a spectator, so why not sit this one out?

117
00:15:07,592 --> 00:15:13,189
Conflict? Mr. Stryker, do you really
want to turn this into some kind of war?

118
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:20,339
I was piloting black ops missions
in North Vietnam

119
00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:23,699
while you were sucking
on your mama's tit at Woodstock.

120
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:27,508
Don't lecture me about war.
This already is a war.

121
00:15:38,064 --> 00:15:41,454
You're dead. You're so dead.
- You're dead.

122
00:15:46,944 --> 00:15:48,980
I don't wanna hurt you.

123
00:15:51,104 --> 00:15:53,104
I'm not afraid.

124
00:16:11,723 --> 00:16:13,723
Logan.

125
00:16:15,243 --> 00:16:17,243
You miss me, kid?

126
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:18,583
Not really.

127
00:16:18,683 --> 00:16:21,063
How are you doing?
- I'm OK. How are you?

128
00:16:21,571 --> 00:16:23,551
Who's this?
- This is Bobby. He's my...

129
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:25,391
I'm her boyfriend.

130
00:16:25,491 --> 00:16:27,766
Call me Ice Man.

131
00:16:30,931 --> 00:16:32,591
Right.

132
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:36,320
Boyfriend? So how do you guys?

133
00:16:36,451 --> 00:16:38,487
We're still working on that.

134
00:16:38,611 --> 00:16:42,160
Look who's come back. Just in time.

135
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,151
For what?

136
00:16:44,251 --> 00:16:47,129
We need a baby-sitter.
- Baby-sitter?

137
00:16:48,405 --> 00:16:50,435
Nice to see you again, Logan.

138
00:16:50,725 --> 00:16:52,725
Hi, Logan.

139
00:16:53,525 --> 00:16:55,145
Hi, Jean.

140
00:16:55,245 --> 00:16:57,918
I should go and get the jet ready.

141
00:16:58,045 --> 00:17:00,434
Well, it was good to meet you.

142
00:17:00,565 --> 00:17:04,135
Come on, let's go.
- Bye, Logan. I'll see you later.

143
00:17:10,846 --> 00:17:13,786
Storm and I are heading to Boston.
We won't be gone long.

144
00:17:13,886 --> 00:17:17,466
The professor wants us to find
a mutant who attacked the president.

145
00:17:17,566 --> 00:17:19,266
So it was a mutant.

146
00:17:19,366 --> 00:17:25,123
You'll be here when we get back,
unless you plan on running off again.

147
00:17:25,246 --> 00:17:29,603
I could probably think of
a few reasons to stick around.

148
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:33,101
Find what you were looking for, Logan?

149
00:17:33,481 --> 00:17:35,261
More or less.

150
00:17:35,361 --> 00:17:37,361
I'll see you boys later.

151
00:17:37,961 --> 00:17:41,078
Be safe, OK?
- You too. Bye.

152
00:17:41,201 --> 00:17:43,201
See ya.

153
00:17:45,321 --> 00:17:48,154
Aren't you gonna welcome me home?

154
00:17:48,761 --> 00:17:51,639
Your bike needs gas.

155
00:17:51,761 --> 00:17:53,761
Then fill her up.

156
00:18:13,678 --> 00:18:17,068
Mr. Laurio, how long can we keep this up?

157
00:18:19,478 --> 00:18:22,390
How long is your sentence?
- Forever.

158
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:28,080
Not necessarily forever, Mr. Lehnsherr.
Just until I've got all that I need.

159
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,092
Mr. Stryker, how kind of you to visit.

160
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:37,375
Have you come back to ensure the taxpayers'
dollars are keeping me comfortable?

161
00:19:00,797 --> 00:19:03,709
Done. You can go.

162
00:19:06,237 --> 00:19:08,237
Now...

163
00:19:10,637 --> 00:19:12,637
Mr. Lehnsherr.

164
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,544
I'd like to have one final talk

165
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:24,108
about the house that Xavier built
and the machine called Cerebro.

166
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:36,917
My tolerance for your smoking
in the mansion notwithstanding,

167
00:19:37,017 --> 00:19:40,237
smoke that in here
and you'll spend the rest of your days

168
00:19:40,337 --> 00:19:42,957
under the belief you are a six-year-old girl.

169
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:47,050
Can you do that?
- I'd have Jean braid your hair.

170
00:19:47,177 --> 00:19:49,177
Welcome back.

171
00:20:08,555 --> 00:20:12,548
You want me to leave?
- No. Just don't move.

172
00:20:18,835 --> 00:20:23,431
These lights represent
every living person on the planet.

173
00:20:25,595 --> 00:20:28,109
The white lights are humans.

174
00:20:30,515 --> 00:20:32,790
And these are the mutants.

175
00:20:36,347 --> 00:20:39,180
Through Cerebro I'm connected to them,

176
00:20:39,307 --> 00:20:41,307
and they to me.

177
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:46,182
You see, Logan?

178
00:20:46,307 --> 00:20:48,662
We're not as alone as you think.

179
00:20:50,947 --> 00:20:53,984
I found the base at Alkali Lake.

180
00:20:54,107 --> 00:20:55,807
There was nothing there.

181
00:20:55,907 --> 00:21:00,607
The broken line represents the path
of the mutant who attacked the president.

182
00:21:00,707 --> 00:21:04,277
I've been finding it
difficult to get a lock on it.

183
00:21:06,603 --> 00:21:09,117
Can't you just concentrate harder?

184
00:21:09,243 --> 00:21:11,632
If I wanted to kill him, yes.

185
00:21:13,452 --> 00:21:15,602
There.

186
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,532
Looks like he's finally stopped running.

187
00:21:34,116 --> 00:21:36,949
I need you to read my mind again.

188
00:21:46,236 --> 00:21:49,896
The results will be the same as before.
- We had a deal.

189
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:56,180
The mind is not a box that can be simply
unlocked. It's a beehive with a million...

190
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,020
Spare me the lecture.

191
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:05,276
I've no doubt your amnesia, your adamantium
skeleton, the claws are all connected, but...

192
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,758
Logan, sometimes the mind
needs to discover things for itself.

193
00:22:12,071 --> 00:22:14,371
I promise you we'll talk again when I return.

194
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:18,942
If you would be kind enough
to watch over the children tonight.

195
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:22,347
Scott and I are going to visit an old friend.

196
00:22:36,391 --> 00:22:39,971
I'm sending the coordinates
of where the mutant's settled.

197
00:22:40,071 --> 00:22:42,891
As soon as you find him,
bring him back to the mansion.

198
00:22:42,991 --> 00:22:47,223
Let's hope he cooperates.
- Yes, for his sake. Good luck.

199
00:23:54,556 --> 00:23:56,911
Stryker, William.

200
00:25:43,758 --> 00:25:46,113
What are you doing in here?

201
00:25:49,838 --> 00:25:51,838
Garbage.

202
00:26:39,607 --> 00:26:42,360
These are the coordinates.

203
00:27:01,693 --> 00:27:06,528
He's a teleporter. Must be why
the professor had trouble locating him.

204
00:27:06,653 --> 00:27:09,486
We're not here to hurt you.

205
00:27:11,453 --> 00:27:13,453
We just wanna talk.

206
00:27:19,476 --> 00:27:21,626
Are you bored yet?
- Oh, yeah.

207
00:27:22,476 --> 00:27:25,274
Sure you don't wanna come down?

208
00:27:47,619 --> 00:27:50,349
You have him?
- He's not going anywhere.

209
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:52,609
Are you?

210
00:27:52,739 --> 00:27:55,399
Please don't kill me.
I didn't mean to harm anyone.

211
00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:58,650
Why would people have gotten that impression?

212
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:02,738
What's your name?
- Wagner. Kurt Wagner.

213
00:28:07,566 --> 00:28:11,844
There was so much shooting, such fear.

214
00:28:11,966 --> 00:28:14,685
And then there was only pain.

215
00:28:16,406 --> 00:28:20,922
I could see it all happening,
but I couldn't stop myself.

216
00:28:21,046 --> 00:28:23,241
It was like a bad dream.

217
00:28:25,201 --> 00:28:27,556
Perhaps he is testing me.

218
00:28:30,841 --> 00:28:34,541
And before you were in the White House,
what do you remember?

219
00:28:34,641 --> 00:28:36,301
Nothing.

220
00:28:36,401 --> 00:28:38,835
I was here.

221
00:28:43,441 --> 00:28:47,431
I'd rather get him back to the professor.
- The professor?

222
00:28:53,266 --> 00:28:57,496
- Did you do these yourself?
- Yes.

223
00:29:03,426 --> 00:29:05,426
And what about this?

224
00:29:26,695 --> 00:29:30,515
I need you to read my mind again.
- The results will be the same as before.

225
00:29:30,615 --> 00:29:33,891
You'll be indestructible.
- No memory.

226
00:29:34,015 --> 00:29:38,327
Sometimes the mind needs
to discover things for itself.

227
00:29:38,455 --> 00:29:40,455
Wolverine.

228
00:29:42,555 --> 00:29:46,628
No memory. You'll have no memory.

229
00:30:18,212 --> 00:30:20,851
Can't sleep?

230
00:30:20,972 --> 00:30:23,042
How can you tell?

231
00:30:23,172 --> 00:30:25,172
Cos you're awake.

232
00:30:25,172 --> 00:30:27,208
Right. How about you?

233
00:30:27,332 --> 00:30:29,402
I don't sleep.

234
00:30:37,412 --> 00:30:41,610
Doesn't anybody sleep around here?
- Apparently not.

235
00:30:44,112 --> 00:30:46,706
Got any beer?
- This is a school.

236
00:30:46,832 --> 00:30:48,932
So that's a no?
- Yeah, that's a no.

237
00:30:49,032 --> 00:30:54,352
Is there anything other than chocolate milk?
- There's soda in that cupboard.

238
00:31:08,531 --> 00:31:10,531
Thanks.
- No problem.

239
00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:21,089
I'll take him from here.

240
00:31:22,449 --> 00:31:24,724
It's all right, Scott.

241
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:27,204
Nice shades.
- Thanks.

242
00:31:57,337 --> 00:32:00,488
Charles Xavier.
Have you come to rescue me?

243
00:32:00,617 --> 00:32:03,177
Sorry, Eric, not today.

244
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:05,397
To what do I owe the pleasure?

245
00:32:08,087 --> 00:32:11,147
The assassination attempt.
What do you know about it?

246
00:32:11,247 --> 00:32:13,107
Nothing.

247
00:32:13,207 --> 00:32:15,482
Only what I read in the papers.

248
00:32:15,607 --> 00:32:18,963
You really shouldn't have to ask.

249
00:32:19,087 --> 00:32:20,947
What's happened to you?

250
00:32:21,047 --> 00:32:25,120
I've had frequent visits from William Stryker.

251
00:32:25,823 --> 00:32:27,973
You remember him, don't you?

252
00:32:31,223 --> 00:32:35,421
His son, Jason, was once
a student of yours, wasn't he?

253
00:32:35,543 --> 00:32:37,543
Yes. Years ago.

254
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:41,785
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to help him.

255
00:32:41,885 --> 00:32:44,225
At least, not in the way his father wanted.

256
00:32:44,325 --> 00:32:50,345
And now you think taking in Wolverine will
make up for your failure with Stryker's son?

257
00:32:55,369 --> 00:32:57,989
How long you been here?
- A couple of years.

258
00:32:58,089 --> 00:33:02,287
And your parents just sent you off
to mutant school?

259
00:33:02,409 --> 00:33:06,322
Actually, my parents think
this is a prep school.

260
00:33:07,706 --> 00:33:12,406
I see. Well, I suppose lots of prep schools
have their own dorms, campuses...

261
00:33:12,506 --> 00:33:14,506
Jets.

262
00:33:16,658 --> 00:33:19,172
So you and Rogue.

263
00:33:19,298 --> 00:33:23,428
It's not what you think.
I'd like it to be, but it's just...

264
00:33:23,498 --> 00:33:30,176
It's just that it's not easy when you
wanna be closer to someone, but you can't.

265
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:37,255
I've seen how you look at Dr. Grey.

266
00:33:37,378 --> 00:33:39,378
Excuse me?

267
00:33:39,418 --> 00:33:40,838
Nothin'.

268
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:46,685
You haven't told him of his past, have you?
- I've put him on the path.

269
00:33:46,785 --> 00:33:48,885
Logan's mind is still fragile.

270
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:51,140
Is it?

271
00:33:51,265 --> 00:33:56,339
Or are you afraid of losing
one of your precious X-Men, old friend?

272
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:02,707
Eric, what have you done?

273
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,667
I'm sorry, Charles.

274
00:34:07,987 --> 00:34:09,987
I couldn't help it.

275
00:34:11,539 --> 00:34:13,539
What have you told Stryker?

276
00:34:15,779 --> 00:34:17,779
Everything.

277
00:34:23,464 --> 00:34:25,773
The war has begun.

278
00:34:30,304 --> 00:34:31,884
Scott!

279
00:34:31,984 --> 00:34:35,414
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

280
00:35:10,427 --> 00:35:13,817
But now and then
every mother needs to get away.

281
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:16,859
Without her, the babies are helpless...

282
00:35:37,547 --> 00:35:39,547
Hi.

283
00:35:56,541 --> 00:35:58,541
What is it?

284
00:36:33,126 --> 00:36:35,126
You picked the wrong house.

285
00:37:14,073 --> 00:37:16,073
You all right?

286
00:37:26,405 --> 00:37:28,405
Stay here.

287
00:38:14,845 --> 00:38:16,845
This way.
- Let's go.

288
00:38:34,608 --> 00:38:37,122
John! Where's Rogue?

289
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:40,957
I don't know.
- I gotta find her.

290
00:38:43,128 --> 00:38:45,596
Open it.
- Here, take her.

291
00:38:50,648 --> 00:38:54,277
Go on, get in. Let's go. Come on.

292
00:38:57,008 --> 00:38:59,966
Take him. He's stunned.

293
00:39:01,196 --> 00:39:03,196
I can help you.
- Help them.

294
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:28,163
Rogue!
- Bobby!

295
00:39:28,163 --> 00:39:30,163
This way.

296
00:39:41,637 --> 00:39:44,549
Come on. Everybody, follow me up here.

297
00:39:49,997 --> 00:39:51,997
Move.

298
00:40:01,124 --> 00:40:03,124
Come on.

299
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:18,164
Let's go.

300
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:22,484
Come on, this way.

301
00:40:27,649 --> 00:40:29,649
This is it.

302
00:40:31,489 --> 00:40:33,029
Logan.

303
00:40:33,129 --> 00:40:36,758
You wanna shoot me, shoot me.
- Don't shoot him.

304
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:39,609
Not yet.

305
00:40:40,609 --> 00:40:42,469
Wolverine?

306
00:40:42,569 --> 00:40:47,149
I must admit this is certainly
the last place I'd expect to find you.

307
00:40:48,068 --> 00:40:50,741
How long has it been? 15 years?

308
00:40:51,748 --> 00:40:53,898
You haven't changed one bit.

309
00:40:54,788 --> 00:40:57,097
Me, on the other hand...

310
00:40:59,868 --> 00:41:01,868
Nature.

311
00:41:06,619 --> 00:41:09,239
Wait. We've gotta do something.
They'll kill him.

312
00:41:09,339 --> 00:41:12,968
He can handle himself. Let's go.
- Bobby.

313
00:41:13,099 --> 00:41:15,099
Please.

314
00:41:15,972 --> 00:41:21,292
I didn't realize Xavier was taking in animals,
even animals as unique as you.

315
00:41:21,332 --> 00:41:23,332
Who are you?

316
00:41:24,892 --> 00:41:27,247
Don't you remember?

317
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:44,132
No!

318
00:41:47,667 --> 00:41:49,667
Logan, come on. Let's go.

319
00:42:04,919 --> 00:42:08,195
Go. I'll be fine.
- But we won't.

320
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:18,719
Go. Keep going.

321
00:42:45,179 --> 00:42:47,374
Right, get in.
- I'm driving.

322
00:42:47,499 --> 00:42:49,888
Maybe next time.

323
00:42:52,979 --> 00:42:55,254
This is Cyclops's car.

324
00:42:55,379 --> 00:42:57,379
Oh, yeah?

325
00:43:15,714 --> 00:43:18,865
What the hell was that back there?

326
00:43:18,994 --> 00:43:20,614
Stryker.

327
00:43:20,714 --> 00:43:22,574
His name is Stryker.

328
00:43:22,674 --> 00:43:26,064
Who is he?
- I can't remember.

329
00:43:35,859 --> 00:43:37,439
Here.

330
00:43:37,539 --> 00:43:39,539
This is yours.

331
00:43:49,692 --> 00:43:53,480
I hate uncomfortable silences.
- What are you doing?

332
00:43:59,452 --> 00:44:02,569
I don't think that's his CD player.

333
00:44:09,499 --> 00:44:12,491
Sit back.
- Where are we going?

334
00:44:12,619 --> 00:44:16,049
Storm and Jean are in Boston.
We'll head that way.

335
00:44:16,139 --> 00:44:18,449
My parents live in Boston.
- Good.

336
00:44:35,177 --> 00:44:36,637
Sergeant?

337
00:44:36,737 --> 00:44:40,117
Most of the mutants
escaped through a series of tunnels.

338
00:44:40,217 --> 00:44:42,037
We have some in custody.
- How many?

339
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:44,137
Six, sir.

340
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:12,208
Welcome, Professor.

341
00:45:33,876 --> 00:45:35,906
Take what we need, gentlemen.

342
00:45:38,516 --> 00:45:44,864
This protest underscores a growing concern
among most Americans. Mutant registration...

343
00:45:44,996 --> 00:45:48,976
Why stop there? It'd be easier
to round up mutants by the truckload.

344
00:45:49,076 --> 00:45:52,436
Or maybe you'd like an all-out war?
- Oh, please.

345
00:45:52,476 --> 00:45:56,594
Turn that shit off, Lou.
- A lot on your mind?

346
00:46:00,564 --> 00:46:02,998
Mr. Laurio?

347
00:46:05,244 --> 00:46:07,599
I'm Grace.

348
00:46:18,362 --> 00:46:20,362
You want another beer?

349
00:46:21,562 --> 00:46:23,562
Of course you do.

350
00:46:31,727 --> 00:46:34,719
You're really aggressive.
- Yes, I am.

351
00:46:37,821 --> 00:46:40,561
I've never hooked up with
a girl like you before.

352
00:46:40,661 --> 00:46:42,661
I know.

353
00:46:44,261 --> 00:46:48,361
It's kind of dirty in here, don't you think?
- That's the idea.

354
00:46:48,461 --> 00:46:49,841
Velcro?

355
00:46:49,941 --> 00:46:51,201
Nice.

356
00:46:52,014 --> 00:46:54,847
Bottoms up.
- I certainly hope so.

357
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:13,094
Bottoms up.

358
00:47:33,262 --> 00:47:36,652
William...
- Please, Xavier, don't get up.

359
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:43,370
I call it the neural inhibitor.
It keeps you outta here.

360
00:47:45,455 --> 00:47:47,915
What have you done with Scott?
- Don't worry.

361
00:47:48,015 --> 00:47:50,555
I'm just giving him a little re-education.

362
00:47:51,045 --> 00:47:53,585
Of course, you know all about that, don't you?

363
00:47:54,249 --> 00:47:58,149
You wanted me to cure your son,
but mutation is not a disease.

364
00:47:58,249 --> 00:48:00,717
You're lying.

365
00:48:01,649 --> 00:48:04,686
You were more frightened of him than I was.

366
00:48:04,809 --> 00:48:09,758
Just one year after Jason returned
from your school, my wife...

367
00:48:09,889 --> 00:48:12,881
You see, he resented us.

368
00:48:13,009 --> 00:48:17,639
He blamed us for his condition,
so he would toy with our minds,

369
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:21,523
projecting visions and scenarios
into our brains.

370
00:48:22,592 --> 00:48:25,789
My wife, in the end,

371
00:48:25,912 --> 00:48:32,829
she took a power drill to her left temple
in an attempt to bore the images out.

372
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:36,103
My boy - the great illusionist.

373
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:48,738
For someone who hates mutants,
you certainly keep some strange company.

374
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:54,014
They serve their purpose,
as long as they can be controlled.

375
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:02,297
You arranged the attack on the president.

376
00:49:05,034 --> 00:49:08,231
You didn't even have to read my mind.

377
00:49:09,834 --> 00:49:13,134
I've been working with mutants
as long as you have, Xavier,

378
00:49:13,234 --> 00:49:18,054
but the most frustrating thing I've learned
is nobody really knows how many even exist

379
00:49:18,154 --> 00:49:20,190
or how to find them.

380
00:49:21,994 --> 00:49:24,189
Except you.

381
00:49:25,241 --> 00:49:28,701
Unfortunately, this little potion
won't work on you, will it?

382
00:49:28,801 --> 00:49:30,861
You're much too powerful for that.

383
00:49:30,961 --> 00:49:33,873
Instead, we'll go right to the source.

384
00:49:36,108 --> 00:49:40,021
Allow me to introduce mutant 143.

385
00:49:41,308 --> 00:49:45,788
The fluid secreted by his brain
acts as a mind-controlling agent.

386
00:49:46,548 --> 00:49:49,108
But that's only where it begins.

387
00:49:49,814 --> 00:49:51,964
Jason?

388
00:49:52,094 --> 00:49:54,892
My God, William. This is your son.

389
00:49:55,014 --> 00:49:58,165
What have you done to him?
- No, Charles.

390
00:49:58,294 --> 00:50:00,489
My son is dead.

391
00:50:02,263 --> 00:50:04,458
Just like the rest of you.

392
00:50:27,325 --> 00:50:29,105
Mom? Dad?

393
00:50:29,205 --> 00:50:31,205
Ronny? Is anybody home?

394
00:50:33,805 --> 00:50:37,081
I'll try and find you some clothes.

395
00:50:37,205 --> 00:50:39,205
Don't burn anything.

396
00:50:52,296 --> 00:50:54,596
I found some of my mom's old clothes.

397
00:50:54,696 --> 00:50:57,608
I think they're from before I was born.

398
00:50:59,776 --> 00:51:01,776
Groovy.

399
00:51:07,796 --> 00:51:12,296
Hello?... Hello?

400
00:51:13,961 --> 00:51:16,031
Jean. Where are you?

401
00:51:47,086 --> 00:51:49,998
These are my grandmother's.

402
00:51:50,126 --> 00:51:52,321
Thanks.

403
00:51:54,406 --> 00:51:56,406
You won't hurt me.

404
00:52:05,526 --> 00:52:07,526
Wow.

405
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,900
I'm sorry.

406
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:25,580
It's OK.

407
00:52:51,985 --> 00:52:54,419
Hey...Ronny, next time you...

408
00:52:56,145 --> 00:52:58,340
Who the hell are you?

409
00:53:01,821 --> 00:53:06,576
Aren't you supposed to be at school?
- Bobby, who is this guy?

410
00:53:07,644 --> 00:53:09,919
This is Professor Logan.

411
00:53:15,564 --> 00:53:18,154
There's something I need to tell you.

412
00:53:38,562 --> 00:53:40,757
You're clear.

413
00:53:57,127 --> 00:53:59,641
Have a nice sleep, Lehnsherr?

414
00:54:02,487 --> 00:54:08,357
There's something different about you.
- Yeah. I was having a good day.

415
00:54:10,087 --> 00:54:12,123
It's not that.

416
00:54:14,103 --> 00:54:16,139
Sit down.

417
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:19,933
Sit your ass down.
- What could it be?

418
00:54:22,147 --> 00:54:24,707
What are you doin'?

419
00:54:27,332 --> 00:54:29,332
There it is.

420
00:54:31,052 --> 00:54:33,247
Too much iron in your blood.

421
00:54:52,819 --> 00:54:58,489
Mr. Laurio, never trust a beautiful woman,
especially one who's interested in you.

422
00:55:46,299 --> 00:55:50,355
So... when did you first know you were a...

423
00:55:52,597 --> 00:55:54,597
A mutant?

424
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,516
Would you cut that out?

425
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:02,420
You have to understand. We thought
Bobby was going to a school for the gifted.

426
00:56:02,701 --> 00:56:05,401
Bobby is gifted.
- We know. We just didn't realize...

427
00:56:05,501 --> 00:56:10,801
We still love you, Bobby.
It's just this mutant problem is a little...

428
00:56:10,882 --> 00:56:12,882
What mutant problem?

429
00:56:14,242 --> 00:56:16,358
...complicated.

430
00:56:16,482 --> 00:56:19,918
What exactly are you a professor of?
- Art.

431
00:56:21,122 --> 00:56:23,511
You should see what Bobby can do.

432
00:56:36,042 --> 00:56:38,954
I can do a lot more than that.

433
00:56:50,651 --> 00:56:52,071
This is all my fault.

434
00:56:52,171 --> 00:56:57,841
Actually, it's males that carry the mutant gene
and pass it on, so it's his fault.

435
00:57:02,691 --> 00:57:04,591
911. Please state your emergency.

436
00:57:04,691 --> 00:57:09,151
I need the police. There are people
in our house. They won't let us leave.

437
00:57:09,251 --> 00:57:14,851
It's believed a manhunt for several fugitives
from the facility is now under way.

438
00:57:18,595 --> 00:57:21,055
Nobody's responding. I can't get a signal.

439
00:57:21,155 --> 00:57:25,068
Why don't you take a break? I'll keep trying.

440
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:58,060
What are they?

441
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:04,739
They're angelic symbols passed on
to mankind by the archangel Gabriel.

442
00:58:06,144 --> 00:58:08,214
They're beautiful.

443
00:58:08,344 --> 00:58:10,574
How many do you have?

444
00:58:11,117 --> 00:58:13,117
One for every sin.

445
00:58:14,077 --> 00:58:16,113
So quite a few.

446
00:58:19,157 --> 00:58:21,796
You and Miss Grey are schoolteachers?

447
00:58:22,151 --> 00:58:26,508
Yes. At a school for people like us,
where we can be safe.

448
00:58:27,511 --> 00:58:29,547
Safe from what?

449
00:58:29,671 --> 00:58:31,671
Everyone else.

450
00:58:34,054 --> 00:58:38,491
Outside of the circus
most people were afraid of me.

451
00:58:38,614 --> 00:58:41,970
But I didn't hate them. I pitied them.

452
00:58:43,054 --> 00:58:45,773
Do you know why?

453
00:58:45,894 --> 00:58:51,844
Most people will never know anything
beyond what they see with their own eyes.

454
00:58:53,581 --> 00:58:56,573
I gave up on pity a long time ago.

455
00:59:01,026 --> 00:59:05,463
Someone so beautiful should not be so angry.

456
00:59:08,426 --> 00:59:12,180
Sometimes anger can help you survive.

457
00:59:13,986 --> 00:59:16,056
So can faith.

458
00:59:16,889 --> 00:59:20,564
Storm, I found an active com device.
- Where?

459
00:59:30,165 --> 00:59:32,963
Oh, God. It's for me.

460
00:59:38,945 --> 00:59:42,574
Have you tried not being a mutant?

461
00:59:43,105 --> 00:59:46,177
No one's left, Jean. Soldiers came.

462
00:59:46,305 --> 00:59:50,445
What about the children?
- I saw them escape. Not sure about the rest.

463
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:52,925
We can't reach the professor or Scott either.

464
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:56,630
Where are you?
- Boston, with Bobby Drake's family.

465
00:59:56,730 --> 01:00:01,645
OK. We're on our way.
- And, Storm, make it fast.

466
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:11,489
We have to go now.
- Why? Logan, what's wrong?

467
01:00:15,762 --> 01:00:18,982
Drop the knives and put your hands in the air.

468
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:21,462
What's going on here?

469
01:00:21,562 --> 01:00:24,634
Ronny.
- I said drop the knives.

470
01:00:25,434 --> 01:00:27,948
Open the door.
- Break it.

471
01:00:29,714 --> 01:00:32,024
Turn around. Up against the wall.

472
01:00:33,146 --> 01:00:37,185
This is just a misunderstanding.
- Put the knives down.

473
01:00:37,306 --> 01:00:39,581
I can't.

474
01:00:40,266 --> 01:00:42,266
Look.

475
01:00:47,024 --> 01:00:50,414
The rest of you, on the ground now.

476
01:00:51,144 --> 01:00:53,180
Kid, I said on the ground.

477
01:01:00,345 --> 01:01:03,018
We don't wanna hurt you, kid.

478
01:01:08,087 --> 01:01:12,877
You know all those dangerous mutants
you hear about on the news?

479
01:01:13,767 --> 01:01:16,361
I'm the worst one.

480
01:01:39,918 --> 01:01:41,918
Get down.

481
01:03:25,213 --> 01:03:27,433
Who the hell is this?
- Kurt Wagner.

482
01:03:27,899 --> 01:03:30,839
In the circus I was known as
'The Incredible Nightcrawler'.

483
01:03:30,939 --> 01:03:34,215
Save it. Storm.
- We're outta here.

484
01:03:55,175 --> 01:03:57,564
Jason, stop it.

485
01:04:21,408 --> 01:04:23,922
It's all right. You can come out.

486
01:04:24,048 --> 01:04:26,048
Have they gone?
- Yes.

487
01:04:30,452 --> 01:04:33,312
Where are all the other students?
- I don't know.

488
01:04:33,778 --> 01:04:36,372
We'll have to find them, won't we?

489
01:04:42,098 --> 01:04:44,098
We'll use Cerebro.

490
01:04:46,978 --> 01:04:48,978
Come on.

491
01:04:58,188 --> 01:05:00,338
How far are we?

492
01:05:00,468 --> 01:05:04,381
We're actually coming up on the mansion now.

493
01:05:04,988 --> 01:05:07,661
I've got two signals approaching.

494
01:05:09,367 --> 01:05:11,367
Coming in fast.

495
01:05:16,127 --> 01:05:19,267
Unidentified aircraft,
you are ordered to descend to 20,000ft.

496
01:05:19,367 --> 01:05:23,867
Return with our escort to Hanscom Air Force
Base. You have ten seconds to comply.

497
01:05:24,388 --> 01:05:27,107
Wow. Somebody's angry.
- I wonder why.

498
01:05:27,228 --> 01:05:31,288
We are coming up alongside you
to escort you to Hanscom Air Force Base.

499
01:05:31,388 --> 01:05:33,388
Lower your altitude now.

500
01:05:37,188 --> 01:05:42,421
Repeat: Lower your altitude to 20,000ft.
This is your last warning.

501
01:05:46,604 --> 01:05:48,604
They're falling back.

502
01:05:51,004 --> 01:05:54,553
They're marking us.
They're gonna fire. Hang on.

503
01:06:04,764 --> 01:06:06,764
I gotta shake 'em.

504
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:16,593
Please don't do that again.
- I agree.

505
01:06:18,603 --> 01:06:21,515
Don't we have any weapons in this heap?

506
01:06:43,774 --> 01:06:45,774
Warning.

507
01:07:28,699 --> 01:07:31,532
Everybody OK back there?

508
01:07:39,006 --> 01:07:41,006
My God. There's two of 'em.

509
01:07:59,416 --> 01:08:01,416
There's one more.

510
01:08:02,496 --> 01:08:04,496
Jean?

511
01:08:06,256 --> 01:08:08,256
Oh, God.

512
01:08:17,082 --> 01:08:19,471
Rogue!
- No!

513
01:09:01,566 --> 01:09:03,566
Jean?
- It's not me.

514
01:09:17,719 --> 01:09:20,519
When will these people learn how to fly?

515
01:09:38,265 --> 01:09:40,265
Thank you.

516
01:09:47,853 --> 01:09:52,449
Can you hear what they're saying?
- I could take a closer look.

517
01:09:53,213 --> 01:09:58,593
His name is Colonel William Stryker, and
he invaded your mansion for one purpose.

518
01:09:59,016 --> 01:10:01,894
He wanted Cerebro.

519
01:10:02,016 --> 01:10:04,816
Or enough of it to build one of his own.

520
01:10:05,283 --> 01:10:09,223
That doesn't make sense. Stryker
would need the professor to operate it.

521
01:10:09,323 --> 01:10:12,743
Which I think is the only reason
my old friend's still alive.

522
01:10:12,843 --> 01:10:14,843
My God.

523
01:10:16,461 --> 01:10:18,121
What are you all so afraid of?

524
01:10:18,221 --> 01:10:22,641
While Cerebro is working, Charles's mind
is connected to every person on the planet.

525
01:10:22,741 --> 01:10:28,201
If he were forced to concentrate hard enough
on a particular group - mutants, for example -

526
01:10:28,301 --> 01:10:31,213
he could kill us all.

527
01:10:31,341 --> 01:10:36,521
Wait. How would Stryker even know
where to find Cerebro in the first place?

528
01:10:39,727 --> 01:10:41,957
Because I told him.

529
01:10:42,087 --> 01:10:45,204
I helped Charles build it, remember?

530
01:10:45,805 --> 01:10:50,003
Mr. Stryker has powerful methods of persuasion,

531
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:53,135
even against a mutant as strong as Charles.

532
01:10:54,332 --> 01:10:57,832
So who is this Stryker anyway?
- He's a military scientist.

533
01:10:58,235 --> 01:11:02,055
He spent his whole life
trying to solve the mutant problem.

534
01:11:02,461 --> 01:11:07,221
If you want a more intimate perspective,
why don't you ask Wolverine?

535
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:10,251
You don't remember, do you?

536
01:11:10,381 --> 01:11:14,641
William Stryker - the only other man I know
who can manipulate adamantium.

537
01:11:15,125 --> 01:11:19,403
The metal on your bones -
it carries his signature.

538
01:11:20,885 --> 01:11:26,164
But the professor...
- He trusted you to discover this on your own.

539
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:29,005
He gives you more credit than I do.

540
01:11:29,435 --> 01:11:31,665
Why do you need us?

541
01:11:31,795 --> 01:11:37,495
Mystique has discovered plans of a base that
Stryker's been operating out of for decades.

542
01:11:37,803 --> 01:11:43,963
We know it's where he's building the second
Cerebro, but we don't know where the base is.

543
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:46,674
And I believe one of you might.

544
01:11:46,799 --> 01:11:48,799
The professor already tried.

545
01:11:48,879 --> 01:11:52,030
Once again, you think it's all about you.

546
01:11:56,359 --> 01:11:58,359
Hello.

547
01:12:03,079 --> 01:12:05,752
I didn't mean to snoop.

548
01:12:05,879 --> 01:12:08,109
Just try and relax.

549
01:12:23,909 --> 01:12:26,139
I'm sorry.

550
01:12:28,407 --> 01:12:32,923
Stryker's at Alkali Lake.
- That's where the professor sent me.

551
01:12:33,047 --> 01:12:36,347
There's nothing left.
- Nothing left on the surface.

552
01:12:36,447 --> 01:12:38,802
The base is underground.

553
01:12:57,185 --> 01:12:59,185
You OK?

554
01:13:00,825 --> 01:13:02,405
Yeah.
- You sure?

555
01:13:02,505 --> 01:13:04,505
How we doin'?

556
01:13:05,587 --> 01:13:09,607
Not good. It looks like four or five hours
before I can get it off the ground.

557
01:13:09,707 --> 01:13:11,937
That's not what I meant.

558
01:13:13,545 --> 01:13:17,663
I'm just worried about Scott.
- I'm worried about you.

559
01:13:17,785 --> 01:13:20,585
That was some display of power up there.

560
01:13:20,705 --> 01:13:25,301
Obviously it wasn't enough.
- Come on.

561
01:13:28,225 --> 01:13:30,225
I love him.

562
01:13:32,505 --> 01:13:34,505
Do you?

563
01:13:35,657 --> 01:13:39,357
Girls flirt with the dangerous guy, Logan.
They don't take him home.

564
01:13:39,848 --> 01:13:42,760
They marry the good guy.

565
01:13:42,888 --> 01:13:45,607
I could be the good guy.

566
01:13:45,728 --> 01:13:48,108
Logan, the good guy sticks around.

567
01:13:54,928 --> 01:13:56,928
Please.

568
01:13:57,845 --> 01:14:00,279
Don't make me do this.
- Do what?

569
01:14:01,325 --> 01:14:03,325
This.

570
01:14:13,265 --> 01:14:15,265
Excuse me.

571
01:14:16,183 --> 01:14:21,052
They say you can imitate anybody,
even their voice.

572
01:14:21,183 --> 01:14:24,016
Even their voice.

573
01:14:24,537 --> 01:14:28,325
Then why not stay in disguise all the time?

574
01:14:29,577 --> 01:14:31,613
Look like everyone else?

575
01:14:32,118 --> 01:14:34,632
Cos we shouldn't have to.

576
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:05,699
Look...

577
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:34,472
No one's ever left a scar quite like you.
- What do you want, an apology?

578
01:15:34,572 --> 01:15:36,572
You know what I want.

579
01:15:38,937 --> 01:15:40,937
But what do you want?

580
01:15:53,235 --> 01:15:55,235
What do you really want?

581
01:15:57,235 --> 01:15:59,235
I want you to get out.

582
01:16:12,907 --> 01:16:14,943
Why don't we get uniforms?

583
01:16:15,067 --> 01:16:18,855
They're on order.
Should arrive in a few years.

584
01:16:26,995 --> 01:16:29,987
We love what you've done with your hair.

585
01:16:33,251 --> 01:16:35,640
Come on, let's go.

586
01:16:42,861 --> 01:16:45,773
So, they say you're the bad guy.

587
01:16:47,769 --> 01:16:50,158
Is that what they say?

588
01:16:52,927 --> 01:16:56,636
It's a dorky-looking helmet.
What's it for?

589
01:16:56,767 --> 01:17:02,717
This dorky-looking helmet is the only thing
that'll protect me from the real bad guys.

590
01:17:07,983 --> 01:17:10,178
What's your name?

591
01:17:10,303 --> 01:17:12,303
John.

592
01:17:12,903 --> 01:17:15,371
What's your real name, John?

593
01:17:21,223 --> 01:17:23,043
Pyro.

594
01:17:23,518 --> 01:17:25,538
Quite a talent you have there, Pyro.

595
01:17:25,638 --> 01:17:28,516
I can only manipulate the fire.

596
01:17:28,638 --> 01:17:30,638
I can't create it.

597
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:36,378
You are a god among insects.
Never let anyone tell you different.

598
01:17:56,385 --> 01:18:00,822
Sir, the machine has been completed
to all specifications.

599
01:18:00,945 --> 01:18:02,945
Good.

600
01:18:06,754 --> 01:18:10,604
If I may ask, sir,
why are we keeping the children here?

601
01:18:11,785 --> 01:18:13,725
I'm a scientist, Sergeant Lyman.

602
01:18:13,825 --> 01:18:17,955
When I build a machine,
I wanna make sure that it's working.

603
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:28,907
All right, this is a topographic map
of the dam. This is the spillway.

604
01:18:29,193 --> 01:18:32,533
See these density changes in the terrain?
They're tire tracks.

605
01:18:32,633 --> 01:18:34,703
That's the entrance.

606
01:18:35,041 --> 01:18:38,061
And this shows the depth of the ice
covering the ground.

607
01:18:38,161 --> 01:18:43,461
This is recent water activity.
- If we go in, Stryker could flood the spillway.

608
01:18:44,029 --> 01:18:46,259
Can you teleport inside?

609
01:18:46,389 --> 01:18:51,769
I have to be able to see where I'm going,
otherwise I could wind up inside a wall.

610
01:18:52,234 --> 01:18:54,270
I'll go.

611
01:18:54,394 --> 01:18:56,254
I've a hunch he'll want me alive.

612
01:18:57,481 --> 01:19:01,061
Whoever goes into the dam needs to be
able to operate the spillway mechanism.

613
01:19:01,149 --> 01:19:03,379
What do you intend to do?

614
01:19:03,509 --> 01:19:06,228
Scratch it with your claws?

615
01:19:07,229 --> 01:19:10,062
I'll take my chances.
- But I won't.

616
01:19:31,795 --> 01:19:35,583
Sir, there's someone coming down the spillway.

617
01:19:40,513 --> 01:19:42,513
I'm flooding it.
- Wait.

618
01:19:47,713 --> 01:19:49,713
Stryker!

619
01:20:03,798 --> 01:20:05,948
Look who's come home.

620
01:20:19,924 --> 01:20:21,924
Move, and you're dead.

621
01:20:52,564 --> 01:20:57,064
The one thing I know better than anyone
is my own work. Seal the room. Shoot it.

622
01:20:57,164 --> 01:20:59,314
Seal the room. Step away.

623
01:21:14,530 --> 01:21:19,160
We have a metamorph loose.
Could be anybody.

624
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:34,406
Can you override the spillway mechanism?
- Only from that room.

625
01:21:34,506 --> 01:21:36,846
That's why the doors are so thick.
- Really?

626
01:21:37,215 --> 01:21:40,730
Get some charges. Blow the doors open.

627
01:21:41,375 --> 01:21:44,173
Take out these cameras.

628
01:21:46,648 --> 01:21:48,718
I'm in.

629
01:21:48,848 --> 01:21:52,204
She's good.
- You have no idea.

630
01:22:04,229 --> 01:22:06,504
Fire in the hole.

631
01:22:12,189 --> 01:22:14,189
Move.

632
01:22:31,895 --> 01:22:35,675
She's opened the spillway doors.
More mutants have entered.

633
01:22:35,775 --> 01:22:38,475
How many?
- We've lost coms - electrical interference.

634
01:22:38,575 --> 01:22:42,195
Sergeant Lyman, gather your men
and meet me outside Cerebro.

635
01:22:42,295 --> 01:22:46,845
You, carry on. When I come back
I want this door open all the way.

636
01:22:58,965 --> 01:23:01,798
Welcome, Professor.

637
01:23:01,925 --> 01:23:04,598
Don't leave me alone. Please?

638
01:23:04,725 --> 01:23:07,239
You can come inside.

639
01:24:02,727 --> 01:24:03,947
Have you found it?

640
01:24:04,047 --> 01:24:07,747
A large portion of energy from the dam
has been diverted to this chamber.

641
01:24:07,847 --> 01:24:09,963
Cerebro.
- There it is.

642
01:24:10,087 --> 01:24:12,396
Can you shut it down from here?

643
01:24:12,527 --> 01:24:15,997
Come. There's little time.
- Not without us.

644
01:24:18,727 --> 01:24:21,525
My God. The children.

645
01:24:22,388 --> 01:24:24,822
Kurt, will you come with me?

646
01:24:24,948 --> 01:24:28,736
Where are they?
- In a cell one level down.

647
01:24:30,548 --> 01:24:34,223
We'll get the children and meet you at Cerebro.

648
01:24:34,348 --> 01:24:37,218
I'll try to find Scott and the professor.

649
01:24:38,286 --> 01:24:42,199
Will you be all right without us?
- I'll be fine.

650
01:24:43,726 --> 01:24:45,726
Where's Logan?

651
01:24:50,446 --> 01:24:52,446
He's gone.

652
01:24:53,832 --> 01:24:56,585
You. Set up a perimeter.

653
01:25:35,905 --> 01:25:37,905
Jason.

654
01:25:44,866 --> 01:25:46,866
It's time.

655
01:25:52,938 --> 01:25:55,327
Time to find our friends.

656
01:26:00,696 --> 01:26:02,866
Is it time to find our friends?

657
01:26:04,004 --> 01:26:06,040
All of them.

658
01:26:06,164 --> 01:26:08,678
All of the mutants.

659
01:26:08,804 --> 01:26:10,804
Everywhere.

660
01:26:11,564 --> 01:26:14,203
Everywhere.
- That's right.

661
01:26:14,324 --> 01:26:17,202
Every one of them?
- Yes.

662
01:26:17,324 --> 01:26:19,324
Good.

663
01:26:20,442 --> 01:26:23,479
It's time to bring it to an end.

664
01:26:26,259 --> 01:26:28,259
Make me proud.

665
01:26:55,656 --> 01:26:58,966
Just don't move.

666
01:27:01,624 --> 01:27:03,933
Kill anyone who approaches.

667
01:27:04,064 --> 01:27:06,259
Even if it's me.

668
01:27:32,277 --> 01:27:33,817
Go! I'll take care of him.

669
01:27:33,917 --> 01:27:38,257
This is one lovers' quarrel
we cannot get involved in, my dear.

670
01:27:48,638 --> 01:27:51,072
Scott!

671
01:27:53,592 --> 01:27:57,062
Help us, anybody!
- Listen.

672
01:27:57,192 --> 01:27:59,308
Help!
- Get us out of here.

673
01:27:59,432 --> 01:28:01,132
Kimberly?
- Storm.

674
01:28:01,232 --> 01:28:03,232
We're coming.

675
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:41,240
Scott, don't do this.

676
01:29:34,197 --> 01:29:37,109
Jean, no, it's OK. It's me.

677
01:29:38,157 --> 01:29:40,157
I'm so sorry.

678
01:29:41,713 --> 01:29:44,227
I thought I'd lost you.
- Oh, God.

679
01:29:46,362 --> 01:29:49,662
I'm so sorry. I could see you,
but I couldn't stop myself. I tried.

680
01:29:49,762 --> 01:29:52,913
I love you so much.
- I love you.

681
01:29:56,045 --> 01:29:58,195
My leg.
- Easy.

682
01:30:02,347 --> 01:30:04,383
Something's wrong.

683
01:30:13,347 --> 01:30:15,347
My God.

684
01:30:19,952 --> 01:30:24,707
Have you found the mutants yet?
Have you found all of them?

685
01:30:24,832 --> 01:30:27,332
I'm trying. There are so many of them.

686
01:30:27,432 --> 01:30:30,105
Then concentrate.

687
01:32:36,912 --> 01:32:40,109
The tricky thing about adamantium is...

688
01:32:40,862 --> 01:32:46,778
If you ever manage
to process its raw, liquid form,

689
01:32:46,902 --> 01:32:49,211
you gotta keep it that way.

690
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:52,864
Keep it hot.

691
01:32:52,984 --> 01:32:56,693
Because once the metal cools,
it's indestructible.

692
01:32:59,395 --> 01:33:01,670
But you already know that.

693
01:33:03,420 --> 01:33:07,095
I used to think you were
one of a kind, Wolverine.

694
01:33:10,540 --> 01:33:12,656
I was wrong.

695
01:33:31,926 --> 01:33:33,926
Holy shit.

696
01:35:18,465 --> 01:35:20,465
That's it.

697
01:35:22,819 --> 01:35:26,239
Where do you think you're going?
- I'm sick of this. I'm going in.

698
01:35:26,339 --> 01:35:28,899
John, they told us to stay here.

699
01:35:29,350 --> 01:35:31,380
You always do as you're told?

700
01:36:32,532 --> 01:36:36,730
Find all the mutants.
All of them. Find them.

701
01:36:38,212 --> 01:36:41,592
Find all the mutants.
Everywhere. Each one. All of them.

702
01:36:41,692 --> 01:36:43,692
Good. Kill them.

703
01:37:33,255 --> 01:37:35,495
Concentrate. Concentrate harder.

704
01:37:35,575 --> 01:37:41,810
Now find them all. Find all the mutants.
Concentrate harder. Each and every one.

705
01:37:41,935 --> 01:37:46,565
Find all the mutants.
Kill them all. Find them all. Kill them.

706
01:37:49,618 --> 01:37:51,813
Cerebro...

707
01:37:52,351 --> 01:37:55,229
We're too late.

708
01:38:04,022 --> 01:38:06,022
Eric, hurry.

709
01:38:53,773 --> 01:38:55,773
That's strange.

710
01:39:34,083 --> 01:39:38,773
How does it look from there, Charles?
Still fighting the good fight?

711
01:39:39,483 --> 01:39:44,477
From here, it doesn't look like
they're playing by your rules.

712
01:39:45,011 --> 01:39:47,923
Maybe it's time to play by theirs.

713
01:40:25,214 --> 01:40:27,489
There's been a change of plan.

714
01:40:46,751 --> 01:40:48,751
Goodbye, Charles.

715
01:41:05,052 --> 01:41:07,032
There's been a change of plans.

716
01:41:07,754 --> 01:41:13,192
Now find them. Focus. Find them all.
The humans. Find all of them.

717
01:41:13,314 --> 01:41:15,828
Every one.

718
01:41:34,392 --> 01:41:36,587
How does it feel, bum?

719
01:41:39,904 --> 01:41:43,164
Why did you come back?
- You cut me open. You took my life.

720
01:41:43,580 --> 01:41:47,080
You make it sound as if
I stole something from you.

721
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:51,412
As I recall, it was you
who volunteered for the procedure.

722
01:41:52,207 --> 01:41:53,587
Who am I?

723
01:41:53,687 --> 01:41:58,203
You are just a failed experiment.

724
01:42:01,207 --> 01:42:04,085
If you really knew about your past -

725
01:42:04,207 --> 01:42:08,485
what kind of person you were,
the work we did together...

726
01:42:10,468 --> 01:42:12,448
People don't change, Wolverine.

727
01:42:12,548 --> 01:42:15,698
You were an animal then.
You're an animal now.

728
01:42:15,748 --> 01:42:18,262
I just gave you claws.

729
01:42:42,348 --> 01:42:44,348
What the hell is that?

730
01:42:44,348 --> 01:42:47,579
What is it?
- The dam's ruptured.

731
01:42:47,708 --> 01:42:52,288
It's gonna flood water into the spillway.
It's trying to relieve the pressure.

732
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:56,872
It's too late. In a few minutes
we'll all be underwater.

733
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,580
Come with me,
and I'll tell you all you wanna know.

734
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:03,940
You can't help your friends.
They're as good as dead, Wolverine.

735
01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:06,040
You're a survivor.

736
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:08,270
Always have been.

737
01:43:09,284 --> 01:43:12,879
I thought I was just an animal with claws.

738
01:43:17,071 --> 01:43:19,187
If we die, you die.

739
01:43:28,327 --> 01:43:31,197
There are no answers that way, Wolverine.

740
01:43:31,207 --> 01:43:34,007
Find all the humans. Each and every one.

741
01:43:34,887 --> 01:43:38,197
Find them. Find all the humans. Kill them.

742
01:43:41,970 --> 01:43:44,609
What is this?
- Cerebro.

743
01:43:49,392 --> 01:43:52,031
Jean, are you OK?
- I'm fine.

744
01:43:52,152 --> 01:43:53,732
What's happening?

745
01:43:54,063 --> 01:44:00,083
Professor's still in there, with another mutant.
He's trapped in some kind of illusion.

746
01:44:01,006 --> 01:44:05,506
Oh, my God. Magneto's reversed Cerebro.
It's not targeting mutants any more.

747
01:44:06,125 --> 01:44:09,834
Who is it targeting?
- Everyone else.

748
01:44:26,736 --> 01:44:28,736
Impossible.

749
01:44:55,901 --> 01:44:59,201
Everybody stand back.
- No. His mind is connected to Cerebro.

750
01:44:59,301 --> 01:45:02,481
Opening it could kill him
and everyone his mind is linked to.

751
01:45:02,581 --> 01:45:06,153
Wait. Kurt, I need you to take me inside.

752
01:45:06,254 --> 01:45:08,284
Who is this guy? Who are you?

753
01:45:08,334 --> 01:45:10,994
My name is Kurt Wagner,
but in the circus...

754
01:45:11,094 --> 01:45:13,210
He's a teleporter.

755
01:45:13,334 --> 01:45:16,929
I told you. If I can't see where I'm going...

756
01:45:17,054 --> 01:45:19,204
I have faith in you.

757
01:45:22,566 --> 01:45:25,638
Don't believe anything you see in there.

758
01:45:51,156 --> 01:45:53,156
Hello.

759
01:45:54,978 --> 01:45:57,492
What are you looking for?

760
01:45:59,304 --> 01:46:02,137
Professor, can you hear me?

761
01:46:02,264 --> 01:46:04,859
You've got to stop Cerebro now.

762
01:46:05,544 --> 01:46:07,978
Who are you talking to?

763
01:46:09,239 --> 01:46:11,434
No, don't move.

764
01:46:11,559 --> 01:46:14,073
But she's just a little girl.

765
01:46:14,199 --> 01:46:16,199
No, she's not.

766
01:46:19,298 --> 01:46:21,892
I've got my eyes on you.

767
01:46:26,978 --> 01:46:28,978
Mr. Stryker.

768
01:46:30,178 --> 01:46:32,931
Funny we keep running into each other.

769
01:46:33,617 --> 01:46:36,529
Mark my words, it'll never happen again.

770
01:46:40,490 --> 01:46:43,562
Kurt, it's about to get very cold in here.

771
01:46:44,210 --> 01:46:46,644
I'm not going anywhere.

772
01:46:53,356 --> 01:46:55,356
What are you doing?

773
01:47:32,555 --> 01:47:36,628
Find all the humans.
Kill them. Every single one of them.

774
01:47:39,206 --> 01:47:41,561
Focus. Find all the humans.

775
01:47:50,686 --> 01:47:52,756
Stop it!

776
01:48:01,086 --> 01:48:03,086
Jason.

777
01:48:04,686 --> 01:48:06,756
He's gonna be so angry at me.

778
01:48:34,799 --> 01:48:38,428
Logan, where are you?

779
01:49:08,669 --> 01:49:11,119
We have to go through the spillway.

780
01:49:49,697 --> 01:49:52,450
You don't wanna go that way. Trust me.

781
01:50:02,137 --> 01:50:04,810
There's another way out of here.

782
01:50:38,322 --> 01:50:40,597
The helicopter was right here.

783
01:51:24,148 --> 01:51:26,821
I will take him.

784
01:51:53,731 --> 01:51:57,804
It's OK, Rogue. You can let go, honey.

785
01:51:58,329 --> 01:52:00,604
Go. I'll be fine.
- You sure?

786
01:52:14,456 --> 01:52:16,626
Who has the answers, Wolverine?

787
01:52:17,416 --> 01:52:19,416
Those people?

788
01:52:19,496 --> 01:52:21,566
That creature in your arms?

789
01:52:37,848 --> 01:52:40,123
I'll take my chances with him.

790
01:52:42,008 --> 01:52:46,047
One day someone will finish
what I've started, Wolverine.

791
01:52:46,168 --> 01:52:48,168
One day!

792
01:52:58,885 --> 01:53:01,240
We've got to get to Washington.

793
01:53:04,005 --> 01:53:06,963
I fear this has gone beyond Alkali Lake.

794
01:53:09,972 --> 01:53:11,972
I got him.

795
01:53:13,492 --> 01:53:15,492
You OK?

796
01:53:16,372 --> 01:53:18,372
I am now.

797
01:53:25,965 --> 01:53:27,825
What's wrong?
- Thrusters off line.

798
01:53:27,925 --> 01:53:30,997
So fix it.
- Has anyone seen John?

799
01:53:31,368 --> 01:53:34,007
Pyro? Where the hell is he?

800
01:53:34,128 --> 01:53:36,517
He's with Magneto.

801
01:53:42,168 --> 01:53:43,988
Come on.

802
01:53:44,088 --> 01:53:46,443
Oh, no. We've lost the power.

803
01:53:57,128 --> 01:54:00,279
There's power in the fuel cells...

804
01:54:48,176 --> 01:54:51,116
Storm, we need some external power.
- Jean?

805
01:54:52,422 --> 01:54:54,422
Where's Jean?

806
01:54:55,742 --> 01:54:57,892
She's outside.

807
01:55:11,716 --> 01:55:14,096
No!..
We're not leaving. Lower the ramp.

808
01:55:28,429 --> 01:55:30,897
Storm, lower it.

809
01:55:31,029 --> 01:55:33,029
I can't.

810
01:55:54,440 --> 01:55:57,238
She's controlling the jet.

811
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:05,270
You, get her, now.
- She's not letting me.

812
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:07,400
Dammit.

813
01:56:14,153 --> 01:56:16,713
I know what I'm doing.

814
01:56:17,719 --> 01:56:19,719
This is...
...the only way.

815
01:56:22,039 --> 01:56:23,659
Jean...

816
01:56:23,759 --> 01:56:25,759
Listen to me.

817
01:56:26,999 --> 01:56:28,619
Don't do this.

818
01:56:28,719 --> 01:56:31,187
Goodbye.

819
01:56:59,342 --> 01:57:01,458
She's gone.

820
01:57:04,765 --> 01:57:07,802
Don't say that. We gotta go back.

821
01:57:07,925 --> 01:57:09,925
She's gone.
- No!

822
01:57:28,725 --> 01:57:31,398
She's gone.

823
01:57:49,018 --> 01:57:52,169
'The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.'

824
01:57:52,298 --> 01:57:55,654
'He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.'

825
01:57:55,778 --> 01:57:59,358
'Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of the death,

826
01:57:59,458 --> 01:58:03,337
I will fear no evil,

827
01:58:03,458 --> 01:58:05,813
for thou art with me.'

828
01:58:19,320 --> 01:58:24,060
'Today I can shed light on recent occurrences
from the attack that ended in this office...'

829
01:58:24,527 --> 01:58:29,107
Morning.'...to the phenomenon that swept
the Earth, nearly annihilating our way of life.'

830
01:58:29,207 --> 01:58:31,727
Do we like this word 'annihilating'?

831
01:58:33,647 --> 01:58:35,647
Good morning.

832
01:58:37,527 --> 01:58:40,564
Good morning, Mr. President.
- Thank you.

833
01:58:47,548 --> 01:58:49,608
Mr. President, we're live in five,

834
01:58:49,708 --> 01:58:51,778
four, three, two...

835
01:58:55,161 --> 01:59:01,270
My fellow Americans, in this time of adversity
we are being offered a moment.

836
01:59:01,401 --> 01:59:05,201
A moment to recognize
a growing threat in our own population

837
01:59:05,247 --> 01:59:09,206
and take a unique role
in the shape of human events.

838
01:59:14,367 --> 01:59:17,643
Did we just lose the feed? Are we still live?

839
01:59:52,116 --> 01:59:54,550
Good morning, Mr. President.

840
01:59:56,781 --> 02:00:00,701
Please, don't be alarmed.
We're not going to harm anyone.

841
02:00:00,941 --> 02:00:03,057
Who are you people?

842
02:00:03,535 --> 02:00:06,335
We're mutants.
My name is Charles Xavier.

843
02:00:06,415 --> 02:00:09,134
Please, sit down.
- I'd rather stand.

844
02:00:09,255 --> 02:00:11,255
Rogue.

845
02:00:12,276 --> 02:00:17,066
These files were taken from
the private offices of William Stryker.

846
02:00:26,548 --> 02:00:28,584
How did you get this?

847
02:00:28,708 --> 02:00:34,066
Let's just say I know a little girl
who can walk through walls.

848
02:00:42,588 --> 02:00:44,783
I've never seen this.
- I know.

849
02:00:44,908 --> 02:00:50,328
So you also know I don't respond to threats.
- This is not a threat. This is an opportunity.

850
02:00:50,428 --> 02:00:56,238
There are forces in this world, mutant and
human alike, who believe a war is coming.

851
02:00:57,108 --> 02:01:01,528
You will see from those files
that some have already tried to start one.

852
02:01:01,928 --> 02:01:07,002
And there have been casualties,
losses on both sides.

853
02:01:12,501 --> 02:01:14,651
Mr. President.

854
02:01:16,384 --> 02:01:20,004
What you are about to tell the world is true.
This is a moment.

855
02:01:20,485 --> 02:01:26,833
A moment to repeat the mistakes of the past,
or to work together for a better future.

856
02:01:27,725 --> 02:01:30,159
We're here to stay, Mr. President.

857
02:01:30,536 --> 02:01:32,606
The next move is yours.

858
02:01:33,576 --> 02:01:35,885
We'll be watching.

859
02:01:54,136 --> 02:01:56,136
Mr. President?

860
02:02:24,556 --> 02:02:31,667
You know, even when Jean was a student,
she was always hesitant about her powers.

861
02:02:31,796 --> 02:02:34,151
Always looking to others.

862
02:02:36,387 --> 02:02:41,700
Feeling that in some way she was left behind.

863
02:02:49,167 --> 02:02:51,687
Could we have done more to save her?

864
02:02:53,007 --> 02:02:56,795
In the past, she may have let us.

865
02:02:57,727 --> 02:03:00,321
There had to be another way.

866
02:03:00,998 --> 02:03:03,273
Why did she leave the plane?

867
02:03:06,358 --> 02:03:09,270
Because she made a choice.

868
02:03:11,798 --> 02:03:14,073
Yes, come on in.

869
02:03:29,295 --> 02:03:30,915
Listen.

870
02:03:31,015 --> 02:03:33,015
She did make a choice.

871
02:03:35,351 --> 02:03:37,351
It was you.

872
02:04:10,161 --> 02:04:12,436
Professor?

873
02:04:12,561 --> 02:04:14,561
Is everything all right?

874
02:04:17,674 --> 02:04:20,313
Yes, I think it will be.

875
02:04:20,434 --> 02:04:26,782
Tell me, have any of you read a book
by an English novelist named TH White

876
02:04:26,914 --> 02:04:29,348
called The Once and Future King?

877
02:04:38,992 --> 02:04:42,621
Mutation: It is the key to our evolution.

878
02:04:42,752 --> 02:04:45,612
It is how we have evolved
from a single-celled organism

879
02:04:45,712 --> 02:04:48,590
into the dominant species on the planet.

880
02:04:49,112 --> 02:04:54,186
This process is slow, normally taking
thousands and thousands of years.

881
02:04:54,312 --> 02:04:59,909
But every few hundred millennia
evolution leaps forward.
